winds, Marutas, and the clouds, P&#7771;içnayas.&mdash;The wind-bulls subdue
the cloud-cows.&mdash;Indras, the rain-sending, thundering, lightening,
radiant sun, who makes the rain fall and the light return, called
the bull of bulls.&mdash;The bull Indras drinks the water of strength.&mdash;Hunger
and thirst of the heroes of mythology.&mdash;The cloud-barrel.&mdash;The
horns of the bull and of the cow are sharpened.&mdash;The
thunderbolt-horns.&mdash;The cloud as a cow, and even as a stable or
hiding-place for cows.&mdash;Cavern where the cows are shut up, of
which cavern the bull Indras and the bulls Marutas remove the
stone, and force the entrance, to reconquer the cows, delivering them
from the monster; the male Indras finds himself again with his
wife.&mdash;The cloud-fortress, which Indras destroys and Agnis sets
on fire.&mdash;The cloud-forest, which the gods destroy.&mdash;The cloud-cow;
the cow-bow; the bird-thunderbolts; the birds come out of
the cow.&mdash;The monstrous cloud-cow, the wife of the monster.&mdash;Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
phenomena of the cloudy sky are analogous to those of the
gloomy sky of night and of winter.&mdash;The moment most fit for an
epic poem is the meeting of such phenomena in a nocturnal tempest.&mdash;The
stars, cows put to flight by the sun.&mdash;The moon, a milk-yielding
cow.&mdash;The ambrosial moon fished up in the fountain, gives
nourishment to Indras.&mdash;The moon as a male, or bull, discomfits,
with the bull Indras, the monster.&mdash;The two bulls, or the two
stallions, the two horsemen, the twins.&mdash;The bull chases the wolf
from the waters.&mdash;The cow tied.&mdash;The aurora, or ambrosial cow,
formed out of the skin of another cow by the &#7770;ibhavas.&mdash;The
&#7770;ibhavas, bulls and wise birds.&mdash;The three &#7770;ibhavas reproduce
the triple Indras and the triple Vish&#7751;us; their three relationships;
the three brothers, eldest, middle, youngest; the three brother
workmen; the youngest brother is the most intelligent, although
at first thought stupid; the reason why.&mdash;The three brothers
guests of a king.&mdash;The third of the &#7770;ibhavas, the third and
youngest son becomes Tritas the third, in the heroic form of
Indras, who kills the monster; Tritas, the third brother, after
having accomplished the great heroic undertaking, is abandoned

has no feet, who leaves no footsteps; she who is without footsteps
of the measure of the feet; she who has no slipper (which
is the measure of the foot).&mdash;The sun who never puts his foot
down, the sun without feet, the sun lame, who, during the night,
becomes blind; the blind and the lame who help each other, whom
Indra helps, whom the ambrosia of the aurora enables to walk and
to see.&mdash;The aurora of evening, witch who blinds the sun; the sun
Indras, in the morning, chases the aurora away; Indras subdues
and destroys the witch aurora.&mdash;The brother sun follows, as a
seducer, the aurora his sister, and wishes to burn her.&mdash;The sun
follows his daughter the aurora.&mdash;The aurora, a beautiful young
girl, deliverer of the sun, rich in treasure, awakener of the sleepers,
saviour of mankind, foreseeing; from small becomes large, from
dark becomes brilliant, from infirm, whole, from blind, seeing and
protectress of sight.&mdash;Night and aurora, now mother and daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
now sisters.&mdash;The luminous night a good sister; the gloomy
night gives place to the aurora, her elder or better sister, working,
purifying, cleansing.&mdash;The aurora shines only when near the sun
her husband, before whom she dances splendidly dressed; the
aurora Urvaçî.&mdash;The wife of the sun followed by the monster.&mdash;The
husband of the aurora subject to the same persecution.</p></blockquote>

<p>We are on the vast table-land of Central Asia; gigantic
mountains send forth on every side their thousand rivers;
immense pasture-lands and forests cover it; migratory
tribes of pastoral nations traverse it; the <i>gopatis</i>, the
shepherd or lord of the cows, is the king; the gopatis
who has most herds is the most powerful. The story
begins with a graceful pastoral idyll.</p>

<p>To increase the number of the cows, to render them
fruitful in milk and prolific in calves, to have them
well looked after, is the dream, the ideal of the ancient
Aryan. The bull, the <i>f&#339;cundator</i>, is the type of every
male perfection, and the symbol of regal strength.</p>

<p>Hence, it is only natural that the two most prominent
animal figures in the mythical heaven should be the cow
and the bull.</p>

<p>The cow is the ready, loving, faithful, fruitful Providence
of the shepherd.</p>

<p>The worst enemy of the Aryan, therefore, is he who
carries off the cow; the best, the most illustrious, of his
friends, he who is able to recover it from the hands of
the robber.</p>

<p>The same idea is hence transferred to heaven; in
heaven there is a beneficent, fruitful power, which is
called the cow, and a beneficent <i>f&#339;cundator</i> of this
same power, which is called the bull.</p>

<p>The dewy moon, the dewy aurora, the watery cloud,
the entire vault of heaven, that giver of the quickening
and benignant rain, that benefactress of mankind,&mdash;are
each, with special predilection, represented as the beneficent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
cow of abundance. The lord of this multiform
cow of heaven, he who makes it pregnant and fruitful
and milk-yielding, the spring or morning sun, the rain-giving
sun (or moon) is often represented as a bull.</p>

<p>Now, to apprehend all this clearly, we ought to go
back, as nearly as possible, to that epoch in which
such conceptions would arise spontaneously; but as the
imagination so indulged is apt to betray us into mere
fantastical conceits, into an <i>à priori</i> system, we shall begin
by excluding it entirely from these preliminary researches,
as being hazardous and misleading, and content ourselves
with the humbler office of collecting the testimonies of
the poets themselves who assisted in the creation of the
mythology in question.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say anything of the Vedic myths
that is not taken from one or other of the hymns contained
in the greatest of the Vedas, but only to arrange
and connect together the links of the chain as they
certainly existed in the imagination of the ancient
Aryan people, and which the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, the work of
a hundred poets and of several centuries, presents to
us as a whole, continuous and artistic. I shall indeed
suppose myself in the valley of Kaçmîra, or on the banks
of the Sindhus, under that sky, at the foot of these
mountains, among these rivers; but I shall search in
the sky for that which I find in the hymns, and not in
the hymns for that which I may imagine I see in the
sky. I shall begin my voyage with a trusty chart, and
shall consult it with all the diligence in my power, in
order not to lose any of the advantages that a voyage so
full of surprises has to offer. Hence the notes will all,
or nearly all, consist of quotations from my guide, in
order that the learned reader may be able to verify for
himself every separate assertion. And as to the frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
stoppages we shall have to make by the way, let me ask
the reader not to ascribe these to anything arbitrary on
my part, but rather to the necessities of a voyage, made,
as it is, step by step, in a region but little known, and by
the help of a guide, where nearly everything indeed is to
be found, but where, as in a rich inventory, it is easier to
lose one's way than to find it again.</p>

<p>The immense vault of heaven which over-arches the
earth, as the eternal storehouse of light and rain, as
the power which causes the grass to grow, and therefore
the animals which pasture upon it, assumes in the Vedic
literature the name of Aditis, or the infinite, the inexhaustible,
the fountain of ambrosia (<i>am&#7771;itasya nabhis</i>).
Thus far, however, we have no personification, as yet we
have no myth. The <i>am&#7771;itas</i> is simply the immortal, and
only poetically represents the rain, the dew, the luminous
wave. But the inexhaustible soon comes to mean that
which can be milked without end&mdash;and hence also, a celestial
cow, an inoffensive cow, which we must not offend,
which must remain intact.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The whole heavens being thus
represented as an infinite cow, it was natural that the
principal and most visible phenomena of the sky should
become, in their turn, children of the cow, or themselves
cows or bulls, and that the <i>f&#339;cundator</i> of the great mother
should also be called a bull. Hence we read that the wind
(<i>Vâyus</i> or <i>Rudrâs</i>) gave birth, from the womb of the celestial
cow, to the winds that howl in the tempest (<i>Marutas</i>
and <i>Rudrâs</i>), called for this reason children of the cow.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
But, since this great celestial cow produces the tempestuous,
noisy winds, she represents not only the serene, tranquil
vault of the shining sky, but also the cloudy and tenebrous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>mother of storms. This great cow, this immense
cloud, that occupies all the vault of heaven and unchains
the winds, is a brown, dark, spotted (<i>p&#7771;içnis</i>) cow; and
so the winds, or Marutas, her sons, are called the children
of the spotted one.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The singular has thus become a
plural; the male sons of the cloud, the winds, are 21;
the daughters, the clouds themselves, called the spotted
ones (<i>p&#7771;içnayas</i>) are also three times seven, or 21: 3 and
7 are sacred numbers in the Aryan faith; and the number
21 is only a multiple of these two great legendary numbers,
by which either the strength of a god or that of a monster
is often symbolised. If <i>p&#7771;içnis</i>, or the variegated cow,
therefore, is the mother of the Marutas, the winds, and of the
variegated ones (<i>p&#7771;içnayas</i>), the clouds, we may say that
the clouds are the sisters of the winds. We often have
three or seven sisters, three or seven brothers in the legends.
Now, that 21, in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> itself, involves a reference
to 3, is evident, if we only observe how one hymn speaks
of the 3 times 7 spotted cows who bring to the god
the divine drink, while another speaks of the spotted
ones (the number not being specified) who give him three
lakes to drink.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Evidently here the 3, or 7, or 21 sister
cows that yield to the god of the eastern heavens their
own nutritious milk, and amidst whose milky humours
the winds, now become invulnerable, increase,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> fulfil the
pious duties of benevolent guardian fates.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>But if the winds are sons of a cow, and the cows are
their nurses, the winds, or Marutas, must, as masculine,
be necessarily represented as bulls. In reality the Wind
(<i>Vâyus</i>), their father, is borne by bulls&mdash;that is, by the
winds themselves, who hurry, who grow, are movable as
the rays of the sun, very strong, and indomitable;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the
strength of the wind is compared to that of the bull or the
bear;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the winds, as lusty as bulls, overcome and subdue
the dark ones.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Here, therefore, the clouds are no longer
represented as the cows that nurse, but with the gloomy
aspect of a monster. The Marutas, the winds that howl
in the tempest, are as swift as lightning, and surround
themselves with lightning. Hence they are celebrated
for their luminous vestments; and hence it is said that
the reddish winds are resplendent with gems, as some
bulls with stars.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> As such&mdash;that is, as subduers of the
clouds, and as they who run impetuously through them&mdash;these
winds, these bulls, are the best friends, the most
powerful helpers, of the great bellowing bull; of the god
of thunder and rain; of the sun, the dispeller of clouds
and darkness; of the supreme Vedic god, Indras, the
friend of light and ambrosia&mdash;of Indras, who brings with
him daylight and fine weather, who sends us the beneficent
dew and the fertilising rain. Like the winds his
companions, the sun Indras&mdash;the sun (and the luminous
sky) hidden in the dark, who strives to dissipate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>shadows, the sun hidden in the cloud that thunders and
lightens, to dissolve it in rain&mdash;is represented as a powerful
bull, as the bull of bulls, invincible son of the cow,
that bellows like the Marutas.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>But in order to become a bull, in order to grow, to
develop the strength necessary to kill the serpent,
Indras must drink; and he drinks the water of strength,
the <i>somas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> "Drink and grow,"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> one of the poets says
to him, while offering the symbolical libation of the cup
of sacrifice, which is a type of the cup of heaven, now
the heavenly vault, now the cloud, now the sun, and now
the moon. From the sweet food of the celestial cow,
Indras acquires a swiftness which resembles that of the
horse;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and he eats and drinks at one time enough to
enable him to attain maturity at once. The gods give
him three hundred oxen to eat, and three lakes of ambrosial
liquor<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> to drink, in order that he may be able to
kill the monster serpent. The hunger and thirst of the
heroes is always proportioned to the miracle they are
called upon to perform; and for this reason the hymns
of the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> and of the <i>Atharvavedas</i> often represent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>the cloud as an immense great-bellied barrel (<i>Kabandhas</i>),
which is carried by the divine <i>bull</i>.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>But when and how does the hero-bull display his extraordinary
strength? The terrible bull bellows, and
shows his strength, as he sharpens his horns:<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the splendid
bull, with sharpened horns, who is able of himself to
overthrow all peoples.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But what are the horns of the
bull Indras, the god of thunder? Evidently the thunderbolts;
Indras is, in fact, said to sharpen the thunderbolts
as a bull sharpens his horns;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> the thunderbolt of Indras
is said to be thousand-pointed;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> the bull Indras is called
the bull with the thousand horns, who rises from the sea<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
(or from the cloudy ocean as a thunder-dealing sun, from
the gloomy ocean as a radiant sun&mdash;the thunderbolt being
supposed to be rays from the solar disc). Sometimes the
thunderbolt of Indras is itself called a bull,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and is
sharpened by its beloved refulgent cows,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> being used, now
to withdraw the cows from the darkness, now to deliver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>them from the monster of darkness that envelops them,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
and now to destroy the monster of clouds and darkness
itself. Besides the name of Indras, this exceedingly
powerful horned bull, who sharpens his horns to plunge
them into the monster, assumes also, as the fire which
sends forth lightning, as that which sends forth rays of
light from the clouds and the darkness, the name of
Agnis; and, as such, has two heads, four horns, three
feet, seven hands, teeth of fire, and wings; he is borne
on the wind, and blows.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Thus far, then, we have heavenly cows which nurture
heavenly bulls, and heavenly bulls and cows which use
their horns for a battle that is fought in heaven.</p>

<p>Let us now suppose ourselves on the field of battle, and
let us visit both the hostile camps. In one we find the sun
(and sometimes the moon), the bull of bulls Indras, with
the winds, Marutas, the radiant and bellowing bulls; in
the other, a multiform monster, in the shape of wolves,
serpents, wild boars, owls, mice, and such like. The bull
Indras has cows with him, who help him; the monster
has also cows, either such as he has carried off from Indras,
and which he imprisons and secretes in gloomy caverns,
towers, or fortresses, or those which he caresses as his
own wives. In the one case, the cows consider the bull
Indras as their friend and liberating hero; in the other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>those with the monster are themselves monsters and
enemies of Indras, who fights against them. The clouds,
in a word, are regarded at one time as the friends of the
rain-giving sun, who delivers them from the monster
that keeps back the rain, and at another as attacked by
the sun, as they who wickedly envelop him, and endeavour
to destroy him. Let us now go on to search, in
the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, the proofs of this double battle.</p>

<p>To begin with the first phase of the conflict, where
in the sky does Indras fight the most celebrated of all
his battles?</p>

<p>The clouds generally assume the aspect of mountains;
the words <i>adris</i> and <i>parvatas</i>, in the Vedic language,
expressing the several ideas of stone, mountain, and
cloud.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The cloud being compared to a stone, a rock,
or a mountain, it was natural,&mdash;1st, To imagine in the
rock or mountain dens or caverns, which, as they imprisoned
cows, might be likened to stables;<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> 2d, To
pass from the idea of a rock to that of citadel, fortress,
fortified city, tower; 3d, To pass from the idea of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>mountain, which is immovable, to that of a tree which,
though it cannot move from its place, yet rears itself
and expands in the air; and from the idea of the tree
of the forest to the shadowy and awe-inspiring grove.
Hence the bull, or hero, or god Indras, or the sun of
thunder, lightning, and rain, now does battle within a
cavern, now carries a fortified town by assault, and
now draws forth the cow from the forest, or unbinds it
from the tree, destroying the <i>rakshas</i>, or monster, that
enchained it.</p>

<p>The Vedic poetry celebrates, in particular, the exploit
of Indras against the cavern, enclosure, or mountain in
which the monster (called by different names and especially
by those of Valas, V&#7771;itras, Cush&#7751;as, of enemy, black
one, thief, serpent, wolf, or wild boar) conceals the herds
of the celestial heroes, or slaughters them.</p>

<p>The black bull bellows; the thunderbolt bellows, that
is, the thunder follows the lightning, as the cow follows
its calf;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> the Marutas bulls ascend the rock&mdash;now, by
their own efforts, moving and making the sonorous stone,
the rock mountain, fall;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> now, with the iron edge of their
rolling chariots violently splitting the mountain;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> the
valiant hero, beloved by the gods, moves the stone;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
Indras hears the cows: by the aid of the wind-bulls he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>finds the cows hidden in the cavern; he himself, furnished
with an arm of stone, opens the grotto of Valas, who keeps
the cows; or, opens the cavern to the cows; he vanquishes,
kills, and pursues the thieves in battle; the bulls
bellow; the cows move forward to meet them; the bull,
Indras, bellows and leaves his seed in the herd; the
thunder-dealing male, Indras, and his spouse are glad
and rejoice.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In this fabled enterprise, three moments must be
noted: 1st, The effort to raise the stone; 2d, The
struggle with the monster who carried off the cows;
3d, The liberation of the prisoners. It is an entire epic
poem.</p>

<p>The second form of the enterprise of Indras in the
cloudy heavens is that which has for its object the
destruction of the celestial fortresses, of the ninety, or
ninety-nine, or hundred cities of Çambaras, of the cities
which were the wives of the demons; and from this
undertaking Indras acquired the surname of <i>puramdaras</i>
(explained as destroyer of cities); although he had
in it a most valuable companion-in-arms, Agnis, that is,
Fire, which naturally suggests to our thoughts the notion
of destruction by fire.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>In a hymn to Indras, the gods arrive at last, bring their
axes, and with their edges destroy the woods, and burn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>the monsters who restrain the milk in the breasts of the
cows.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The clouded sky here figures in the imagination
as a great forest inhabited by <i>rakshasas</i>, or monsters,
which render it unfruitful&mdash;that is, which prevent the
great celestial cow from giving her milk. The cow that
gives the honey, the ambrosial cow of the Vedâs, is thus
replaced by a forest which hides the honey, the ambrosia
beloved by the gods. And although the Vedic hymns
do not dwell much upon this conception of the cloudy-sky,
preferring as they do to represent the darkness of night
as a gloomy forest, the above passage from the Vedâs is
worthy of notice as indicating the existence at least
during the Vedic period of a myth which was afterwards
largely amplified in zoological legend.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>In this threefold battle of Indras, we must, moreover,
remark a curious feature. The thunder-dealing Indras
overpowers his enemies with arrows and darts; the same
cloud which thunders, bellows, and therefore is called a
cow, becomes, as throwing darts, a bow: hence we
have the cow-bow, from which Indras hurls the iron
stone, the thunderbolt; and the cord itself of that
bellowing bow is called a cow; from the bow-cow, from
the cord-cow, come forth the winged darts, the thunderbolts,
called birds, that eat men; and when they come
forth, all the world trembles.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> We shall come upon the
same idea again further on.</p>

<p>Thus far we have considered the cow-cloud as a victim
of the monster (that Indras comes to subdue). But it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>not uncommon to see the cloud itself or the darkness,
that is, the cow, the fortress, or the forest represented as
a monster. Thus, a Vedic hymn informs us that the
monster Valas had the shape of a cow;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> another hymn
represents the cloud as the cow that forms the waters,
and that has now one foot, now four, now eight, now
nine, and fills the highest heaven with sounds;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> still
another hymn sings that the sun hurls his golden disc
in the variegated cow;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> they who have been carried off,
who are guarded by the monster serpent, the waters, the
cows, are become the wives of the demons;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and they
must be malignant, since a poet can use as a curse the
wish that the malign spirits, the demons, may drink the
poison of those cows.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> We have already seen that the
fortresses are wives of demons, and that the demons possessed
the forests.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>It is in the beclouded and thundering heavens that
the warrior hero displays his greatest strength; but it
cannot be denied that the great majority of the myths,
and the most poetical, exemplify or represent the relation
between the nocturnal sky (now dark, tenebrous,
watery, horrid, wild, now lit up by the ambrosial moon-beams,
and now bespangled with stars) and the two
glowing skies&mdash;the two resplendent ambrosial twilights of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>morning and evening (of autumn and spring). We have
here the same general phenomenon of light and darkness
engaged in strife; here, again, the sun Indras is hidden,
as though in a cloud, to prepare the light, to recover from
the monster of darkness the waters of youth and light,
the riches, the cows, which he keeps concealed; but this
conquest is only made by the hero after long wandering
amidst many dangers, and is finally accomplished by
battles, in which the principal credit is often due to a
heroine; except in those cases, not frequent but well
worthy of remark, in which the clouds, hurricanes,
tempests of lightning and thunderbolts, coincide with
the end of the night (or of winter), and the sun Indras,
by tearing the clouds, at the same time disperses
the darkness of night and brings dawn (or spring)
back to the sky. In such coincidences, the sun Indras,
besides being the greatest of the gods, reveals himself to
be also the most epic of the heroes; the two skies, the
dark and the clouded, with their relative monsters, and
the two suns, the thundering and the radiant, with
their relative companions, are confounded, and the myth
then assumes all its poetical splendour. And the most
solemn moments of the great national Aryan epic poems,
the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> and the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, the <i>Book
of Kings</i>, as well as those of the <i>Iliad</i>, the <i>Song of
Roland</i> and the <i>Nibelungen</i>, are founded upon this very
coincidence of the two solar actions&mdash;the cloudy and
shadowy monster thunderstruck, and the dawn (or spring)
delivered and resuscitated. In truth, the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> itself,
in a passage already quoted,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> tells us that the clouds&mdash;the
three times seven spotted cows&mdash;cause their milk
to drop to a god (whom, from another similar passage,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>we know to be Indras, the sun) in the eastern sky (<i>pûrve
vyomani</i>), that is, towards the morning, and sometimes
towards the spring, many of the phenomena of which
correspond to those of the aurora. The <i>P&#7771;içnayas</i>, or
spotted ones, are beyond doubt the clouds, as the Marutas,
sons of P&#7771;içnis, or the spotted one, are the winds that
howl and lighten in the storm cloud. It is therefore
necessary to carry back the cloudy sky towards the
morning, to understand the P&#7771;içnayas feeding the sun
Indras in the eastern heavens and the seven <i>Añgirasas</i>,
the seven sunbeams, the seven wise men, who also sing
hymns in the morning;&mdash;it seems to me that the hymn
of these fabled wise men can be nothing else than the crash
of the thunderbolts, which, as we have already seen, are
supposed to be detached from the solar rays. Allusions
to Indras thundering in the morning are so frequent in the
Vedic hymns, that I hope to be excused for this short
digression, from which I must at once return, because my
sole object here is to treat in detail of the mythical animals,
and because the road we have to take will be a long one.</p>

<p>Even the luminous night has its cows; the stars, which
the sun puts to flight with his rays,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> are cows: the cows
themselves, whose dwellings the dwellings of the sun's
cows must adjoin, are called the many-horned ones.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
These dwellings seem to me worthy of passing remark,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>they are the celestial houses that move, the enchanted
huts and palaces that appear, disappear, and are transformed
so often in the popular stories of the Aryans.</p>

<p>The moon is generally a male, for its most popular
names, <i>&#262;andras</i>, <i>Indus</i>, and <i>Somas</i> are masculine; but
as Somas signifies ambrosia, the moon, as giver of
ambrosia, soon came to be considered a milk-giving cow;
in fact, moon is one among the various meanings given in
Sanskrit to the word <i>gâus</i> (cow). The moon, Somas, who
illumines the nocturnal sky, and the pluvial sun, Indras,
who during the night, or the winter, prepares the light of
morn, or spring, are represented as companions; a young
girl, the evening, or autumnal, twilight, who goes to draw
water towards night, or winter, finds in the well, and takes
to Indras, the ambrosial moon, that is, the Somas whom
he loves. Here are the very words of the Vedic hymn:&mdash;"The
young girl, descending towards the water, found the
moon in the fountain, and said: 'I will take you to Indras,
I will take you to Çakras; flow, O moon, and envelop
Indras.'"<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The moon and ambrosia in the word indus, as
well as somas, are confounded with one another; hence,
Indras, the drinker <i>par excellence</i> of <i>somas</i> (somapâtamas),
is also the best friend and companion of the ambrosial or
pluvial moon, and so the sun and moon (as also Indras
and Vish&#7751;us) together come to suggest to us the idea of
two friends, two brothers (Indus and Indras), two twins,
the two Açvinâu; often the two twilights, properly
speaking, the morning and the evening, the spring and
the autumn, twilights, the former, however, being especially
associated with the red sun which appears in the
morning (or in the spring), and the latter with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
pale moon which appears in the evening (or in the
autumn, as a particular regent of the cold season). Indras
and Somas (<i>Indrâsomâu</i>) are more frequently represented
as two bulls who together discomfit the monster (<i>rakshoha&#7751;âu</i>),
who destroy by fire the monsters that live in
darkness.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The word <i>v&#7771;isha&#7751;âu</i> properly means the two
who pour out, or fertilise. Here it means the two bulls;
but as the word <i>v&#7771;ishan</i> signifies stallion as well as bull,
the two stallions, the v&#7771;isha&#7751;âu Indras and Somas, are, by
a natural transition, soon transformed into two horses or
horsemen, the two Açvinâu. Hence, in popular tales, we
find near the young princess the hero, who now leads out
the cows to pasture, and now, as hostler or groom, takes
excellent care of the horses. But we must not anticipate
comparisons which we shall have to make further on.
Having noticed that, in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, we find the moon
represented either as a bull or a cow (the masculine, <i>Indus</i>,
<i>somas</i>, <i>&#263;andras</i>, is always a bull; while the feminine, <i>râkâ</i>,
suggests more naturally the idea of a cow), let us now
consider the bull Indras in relation to the cow Aurora
(or spring).</p>

<p>Five bulls stand in the midst of the heavens, and chase
out of the way the wolf who crosses the waters;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the
luminous Vasavas unbind the cow that is tied by its foot.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>How now is this cow brought forth?</p>

<p>This ambrosial cow is created by the artists of the
gods, by the three brothers <i>&#7770;ibhavas</i>, who draw it out
of the skin of a cow; that is, they make a cow, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>to give it life, cover it with the skin of a dead cow.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> It
being understood that the cow Aurora (or Spring) dies
at even (or in the autumn), the &#7770;ibhavas, the threefold sun
Indras, <i>i.e.</i>, the sun in the three watches of the night, prepares
the skin of this cow, one &#7770;ibhus taking off the skin
from the dead cow, another &#7770;ibhus preparing it during
the night (or winter), and the third &#7770;ibhus, in the early
morning (or at the end of winter) dressing the new cow,
the aurora (or the spring) with it. Thus it is that Indras,
in three distinct moments, takes the skin from off the girl
that he loves, who had become ugly during the night,
and restores her beauty in the morning.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> And the three
&#7770;ibhavas may, it seems to me, be the more easily identified
with the triple Indras, with Indra-Vish&#7751;us, who
measures the world in three paces, since, as Indras is
called a bull, they also are called bulls;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> as Indras is
often a falcon, they also are named birds;<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and their
miracles are sometimes also those of Indras. This identification
of the bulls &#7770;ibhavas, whom we speak of here as
producers of the cow Aurora (the same sterile cow of the
sleeping hero Çayus, that which the Açvinâu, the two
horsemen of the twilight, restored to youth by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>&#7770;ibhavas, rendered fruitful again),<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> with the bull, or
hero Indras, appears to me to be of the greatest importance,
inasmuch as it affords us the key to much that is
most vital to the Aryan legends.</p>

<p>The &#7770;ibhavas, then, are three brothers. They prepare
themselves to procure the cups which are to serve for
the gods to drink out of. Each has a cup in his hand;
the eldest brother defies the others to make two cups
out of one; the second defies them to make three out of
one; the youngest brother comes forward and defies them
to make four. The victory is his, and the greatest workman
of heaven, the Vedic Vulcan, <i>Tvashtar</i>, praises their
wonderful work.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The youngest of the three brothers is
therefore the most skilful. We find in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> the
name of <i>Sukarmas</i>, or maker of fine works, good workman,
given to each of the three brothers; and though
only one of them, who is properly called &#7770;ibhus, or <i>&#7770;îbhukshâ</i>,
is said to serve the god Indras in the quality of
a workman (whence Indras himself sometimes received
the name of &#7770;ibhukshâ, &#7770;ibhvan, or &#7770;ibhvas), yet the
other two brothers, <i>Vâ&#501;as</i> and <i>Vibhvan</i>, are in the
service, one of all the gods, the other of Varu&#7751;as, the
god of night.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It would seem natural to recognise in
&#7770;ibhus, the protégé of Indras, the most skilful of the
three brothers, who, as we have seen above, was the
youngest; yet, as we cannot infer anything from the
order in which the hymns name the three brothers&mdash;as,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>in one, Vâ&#501;as is first named, then &#7770;ibhukshâ, and finally
Vibhvan; in another, Vâ&#501;as first, Vibhvan second, and
&#7770;ibhus third;<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> in another, again, &#7770;ibhus is invoked
first, then Vibhvan, and lastly Vâ&#501;as; and as we also
find all the &#7770;ibhavas saluted under the common epithet
of Vâ&#501;as, and Vâ&#501;as himself by the name of Indras,
or rather Indras saluted in his triple form of &#7770;ibhus,
Vibhvan, and Vâ&#501;as,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> it remains uncertain which of these
was the proper name of the third brother of the &#7770;ibhavas.
But what seems to be sufficiently clear is, that Indras is
identified with the &#7770;ibhavas (<i>Indravantas</i>), that the
third brother is the most skilful, and that the three
brothers serve the lords of heaven as workmen. And
here we meet with an interesting element. In two
hymns of the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, the host of the &#7770;ibhavas appears
as one only, Indras himself, or the sun (Savitar), under
the name of <i>Agohyas</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, who cannot be hidden).
During the twelve days (the twelve hours of the night,
or the twelve months of the year) in which they are the
guests of Agohyas, they bring as they sleep every species
of prosperity to the land, by making the fields fertile,
causing the rivers to flow, and refreshing the grass of the
field. In this, however, let us not forget that they are the
beneficent sons of <i>Sudhanvan</i>, the good archer, and archers
themselves, representatives of the great celestial archer,
of the thunder-dealing and rain-giving Indras; and that
therefore their sleep is only a figure of speech to express
their latent existence in darkness and the clouds of night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>But the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> introduces the three brothers under
other names, and especially in one, and that an important
aspect. The third brother is called <i>Tritas</i>, or
the third, and as such, is also identified with Indras.
Thus, for instance, the moments of Indras in the sky are
three&mdash;evening, night, and towards morning; and the
horse of Tritas (the horse that Tritas has received from
<i>Yamas</i>) is now mysteriously Yama himself, now the son
of Âditis (whom we have already seen to be the cow, or
the son of the cow), now Tritas himself, whom Tritas
alone can yoke, and Indras alone ride upon, a horse bedewed
with ambrosia, which has three relationships in
heaven, three in the waters, three in the ocean;<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> that is to
say, one relation is Yamas, the elder brother; the second is
the son of the cow, or the second brother; the last is Tritas
himself, or the youngest brother. This Tritas is called
intelligent; he therefore corresponds to the third brother,
who makes four cups out of one. How then does he
appear sometimes stupid? The language itself supplies
the explanation. In Sanskrit, <i>bâlas</i> means both child and
stolid; and the third brother is supposed to be stolid, because,
at his first appearance especially, he is a child,&mdash;and
we constantly see him as a child do wonderful things, and
give proofs of superhuman wisdom. With this key, the
meaning of the myth is obvious. The eldest brother,
Yamas, the dying sun, with all his wisdom and experience,
is unable of himself to recover the ravished or
missing princess; the son of the cow Âditis, that is,
Âdityas, the sun in the middle of the night, gives often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
proof of strength great enough to disperse the darkness
and the clouds, and break the incantation; but, generally
it is the third sun, the morning sun, Indras in his third
moment, Vish&#7751;us taking his third step,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> the third brother,
Tritas, who seems to obtain the victory, and deliver the
young aurora from the monster of night. All this seems
to me to be very evident.</p>

<p>Tritas, like Indras, drinks the water of strength, and
thereupon tears the monster in pieces;<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> the victory of the
young hero must be achieved in the same way in which
it is accomplished by Indras, his more splendid and
grandiose impersonation. But Tritas, or <i>Trâitanas</i>, after
having killed the monster of the waters, is afraid that the
waters themselves may devour him; after cutting off the
head of the monster, some enemies have lowered him
down into the waters.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The sun has vanquished the
monster that kept the fountain of waters shut&mdash;he has
unchained the waters, but he himself has not been able
to break through the cloud; he has delivered from the
dark and cloudy monster the princess, the dawn that was
to have been its prey, but he himself does not yet come
forth&mdash;is still invisible. Now, who are the enemies here
that have placed the young hero in the cistern, down into
the well, in the sea? We have already seen that Tritas has
two brothers; and it is these two brothers who, in a fit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>of jealousy, on account of his wife, the aurora, and the
riches she brings with her from the realm of darkness, the
cistern or well, detain their brother in the well,&mdash;all
which is told us in a single but eloquent verse of the
Vedas. The intelligent Tritas in the well calls out (<i>rebhati</i>)
on account of his brothers;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and the two horsemen of the
twilight, the Açvinâu, come to deliver the invoker (<i>rebhas</i>)
covered and enveloped by the waters.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> In another hymn,
the deliverer appears to be B&#7771;ihaspatis, the lord of prayer,
who having heard how Tritas, thrust down into the well,
was invoking the gods, made the large from the small;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
that is to say, opened for the young hero a way to escape
from the well and show himself in his glory.</p>

<p>Having seen how in the Vedic hymns Tritas, the third
brother, and the ablest as well as best, is persecuted by his
brothers, it is interesting to note the form of the myth
in popular Hindoo tradition:&mdash;"Three brothers, <i>Ekatas</i>
(<i>i.e.</i>, the first), <i>Dvitas</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the second), and <i>Tritas</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the
third), were travelling in a desert, and distressed with
thirst, came to a well, from which the youngest, Tritas,
drew water and gave it to his seniors. In requital, they
threw him into the well, in order to appropriate his property,
and having covered the top with a cart-wheel, left
him within it. In this extremity he prayed to the gods to
extricate him, and by their favour he made his escape."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Thus have we brought the three brothers, of whom
Tritas is the youngest, into close affinity with the three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>&#7770;ibhavas, and both the former and the latter into an
equally close connection with the three moments of Indras.
We have already said that the &#7770;ibhavas created the cow;
in the same way <i>Uçanâ Kâvyâs</i>, the desiring wise one
protected by Indras, another name for the sun-hero of the
morning, sends the cows together before him;<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and Indras
himself is the only lord of the cows, the only real celestial
shepherd;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> or, rather, it is he that begets the sun and
the aurora,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> or, as another hymn says, who gives the
horses and the sun and the cow of abundance.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Here, therefore, the aurora is explicitly the cow of
abundance; she is still also the milk-giving and luminous
cow, in which is found all sweetness;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and finally, <i>usrâ</i>
or <i>ushâ</i> are two words, two appellations, which indiscriminately
express aurora and cow as the red or brilliant
one. The identification of the aurora with the cow, in
the mythical sky of the Vedas, is therefore a certainty.</p>

<p>Another of the names which the milk-yielding cow
assumes in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, besides the ordinary one of
<i>Ushâ</i>, is <i>Sîtâ</i>, whom Indras also causes to descend from
heaven, like the aurora, and who must be milked by the
sun-god <i>Pûshan</i>,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> the nourisher, the <i>f&#339;cundator</i>, compared
in one hymn to a pugnacious buffalo.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> This Indras, protector
and friend of Sîtâ, prepares therefore Vish&#7751;us, the
protector, in the form of Râmas, of his wife Sîtâ. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>even the &#7770;ibhavas are the protectors of the cow, as well
as the producers.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>But Indras, whose special function it is to lighten, to
thunder, to fight the monster of darkness, and to prepare
the light, generally figures in the popular imagination, at
dawn (aurora), as the sun, under his three names of
<i>Sûryas</i>, of <i>&#7770;itas</i>, and of <i>Savitar</i>.</p>

<p>The sun, with respect to the aurora, is now the father,
now the husband, now the son, and now the brother.
As begotten of Indras simultaneously with the aurora, he
is the brother; as following and embracing the aurora,
he is the husband; as simply coming after the aurora, he
is the son; and as sending the cow or the aurora before
him, he is the father. These four relationships of the sun
to the aurora or dawn are all mentioned in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>.</p>

<p>In one of the hymns, the pure effulgence with which
the aurora chases away the shadows of night is said to
resemble the milk of a cow;<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> that is, the whitish light of
the daybreak precedes in the eastern heavens the rosy
light of aurora. The aurora is the cow-nurse, and the
oriental mother of the old sun; at the sound of the
hymn in praise of the dawn, the two horsemen of twilight,
the Açvinâu, awaken.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Two cows&mdash;[<i>i.e.</i>, the two twilights,
that of the evening and that of the morning, related to
the two horsemen, the evening one and the morning one,
whom we also find together in the morning, the one
white and the other red, the one in company with daybreak
and the other with the aurora, and who may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>therefore be sometimes identified with the two morning
dawns, the white dawn (alba) or daybreak, and the red
dawn (aurora), and, from another point of view, the lunar
dawn and the solar one]&mdash;drop milk towards the sun, in
the heaven.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The aurora is the mother of the cows.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>As the sun approaches, the heavenly cows, who walk
without covering themselves with dust, celebrate him<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
with songs. The red rays of the high sun fly and
join themselves to the sun's cows.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The seven wise
<i>Añgirasas</i> (the seven solar rays, or else the Angiras,
the seven-rayed or seven-faced sun, as another hymn<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
represents him) celebrate in their songs the herds of cows
which belong to the aurora, who appears upon the mountain.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
Let us notice more particularly what is said of
the aurora that appears with the cows upon the mountain.
It is the sun that enables the Añgirasas to split the
mountain, to bellow along with the cows, and to surround
themselves with the splendour of the aurora.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The
aurora, the daughter of the sky, the splendid one, appears;
at the same time, the sun draws up the cows.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
The aurora is carried by red luminous cows, whilst the
.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>sun, the hero-archer, kills the enemies.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The aurora
breaks open the prison of the cows; the cows exult towards
the aurora;<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> the aurora comes out of the darkness
as cows come out of their stable.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> As the solar hero,
Indras, is the guardian or shepherd of horses and of cows,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
so the auroras are often celebrated in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> as
<i>açvâvatîs</i> and <i>gomatîs</i>, that is, as provided with and
attended by horses and cows. The aurora keeps together
the herd of red cows, and always accompanies them.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Thus have we passed from the pastor-hero to the
pastoral heroine upon the mountain. The pastoral
aurora, unveiling her body in the east, follows the path of
the sun;<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and the sun is represented to us in the following
riddle as a wonderful cowherd:&mdash;"I have seen a
shepherd who never set down his foot, and yet went and
disappeared on the roads; and who, taking the same and
yet different roads, goes round and round amidst the
worlds."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The sun goes round in the ether, and never
puts down a foot, for he has none; and he takes the same,
yet different, roads in the sky, <i>i.e.</i>, luminous by day, and
gloomy by night. The puzzle of the riddle lies in its
self-contradiction; and the beautiful girl is the prize appointed
for him who, by his actions, resolves it. A similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>riddle is, in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> itself, proposed to <i>Mitras</i>, the
sun, and to <i>Varu&#7751;as</i>, the night. The riddle is as follows:&mdash;"The
first of them who walk afoot (<i>padvatînam</i>) comes
without feet (<i>apâd</i>);" and the two divine heroes are
asked, "Which of you two has guessed it?"<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> He who
solves this enigma we may be sure is Mitras, the sun, who
recognises the aurora, the girl who comes making use of
feet, although she seem to have none, for she comes
borne in a chariot, of which the wheels appear to be feet,
which is the same luminous chariot that rolls well,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> given
by the &#7770;ibhavas to the two horsemen Açvinâu (represented
sometimes as two old men made young again by the &#7770;ibhavas,
and sometimes simply as two handsome youths),
into which chariot she mounts by the help of the Açvinâu;
and the daughter of the sun is, in the race, the first to
come to the winning-post, amid the enthusiastic plaudits
of the gods.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Then the hymns to the aurora sometimes
represent that vast chariot as belonging to the eastern
aurora, who guides a hundred chariots, and who, in turn,
helps the immortal gods to ascend into the chariot beside
her.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The aurora, as the first of those who appear every
day in the eastern sky, as the first to know the break of
day,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> is naturally represented as one of the swiftest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>among those who are the guests of the sun-prince during
the night; and like her cows, which do not cover themselves
with dust (this being an attribute which, in the
Indian faith, distinguishes the gods from mortals, for
the former walk in the heavens, and the latter upon
earth), she, in her onward flight, leaves no footsteps
behind her. The word <i>apâd</i> (<i>pad</i> and <i>pada</i>, being
synonymous) may, indeed, mean not only she who has no
feet, but also she who has no footsteps (that is, what is the
measure of the foot), or, again, she who has no slippers,
the aurora having, as appears, lost them; for the prince
Mitras, while following the beautiful young girl, finds a
slipper which shows her footstep, the measure of her foot,
a foot so small, that no other woman has a foot like it,
an almost unfindable, almost imperceptible foot, which
brings us back again to the idea of her who has no feet.
The legend of the lost slipper, and of the prince who tries
to find the foot predestined to wear it, the central interest
in the popular story of Cinderella, seems to me to repose
entirely upon the double meaning of the word <i>apâd</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
who has no feet, or what is the measure of the foot,
which may be either the footstep or the slipper; often,
moreover, in the story of Cinderella, the prince cannot
overtake the fugitive, because a chariot bears her
away.</p>

<p>The word <i>apâd</i>, which we have heretofore seen applied
to the heroine, was applied, moreover, to the hero, giving
rise to another popular legend, of which the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>
offers us the mythical elements. We have already seen
the sun as <i>anipadyamanas</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the sun who never puts
his foot down; but this sun who never puts down his
foot easily, came to be conceived of and represented as
a sun without feet, or as a lame hero, who, during the
night, by the perfidy of the witch, the dusk of evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
became also blind. In one hymn, the blind and the lame
are not one, but two, whom propitious Indras guides;<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
in another, the blind-lame is one person, with the
name of <i>Pârav&#7771;ig</i>, whom the two horsemen Açvinâu,
the two friends of the dawn, enable to walk and to see.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
The lame one who sees, shows the way to the blind who
is able to walk, or the lame carries the blind; Indras, the
hidden sun, guides the blind and the lame; or, the blind
and the lame, lost in the forest, help each other; in the
morning, the Açvinâu, the two horsemen, friends of the
aurora, with the water of sight and of strength (that is,
Párav&#7771;ig, the blind-lame having discovered the hidden
fountain of the young girls of the dawn,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> with the
ambrosia of the aurora, with the aurora itself), make the
blind see, and him who has no feet, the lame, walk; that
is, they burst forth into the upper air again, transfigured
now into the luminous sun who sets out on his heavenly
voyage. I have said above that the hero becomes blind
and lame through the perfidy and magic of the evening
aurora: nor was the assertion unfounded; for the Vedic
hymn in which Indras guides the blind and the lame,
<i>i.e.</i>, himself or the sun, in the gloomy tardy night, is the
very same hymn in which is celebrated his heroic and
manly enterprise of the destruction of the daughter of
the sky. The sun Indras revenges himself in the morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>upon the aurora of the morning, for the wrong done
him by the aurora of the evening, beautiful, but faithless.</p>

<p>For the aurora counts among her other talents that of
magic; when the &#7770;ibhavas created the aurora cow of
morning, investing her with the skin of the aurora cow
of evening, they endowed her with Protean qualities
(<i>Viçvarûpâm</i>), and on this account the aurora herself is
also called witch or enchantress (<i>Mâjinî</i>).<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> This aurora,
this virago, this Amazon, this Vedic Medea, who,
treacherously plunging her husband, or brother, the solar
hero, into a fiery furnace, blinds and lames him, is
punished in the morning for her crime of the evening.
The hero vanquishes her, overcomes her incantations, and
annihilates her. The Vedic hymn sings&mdash;"A manly
and heroic undertaking thou hast accomplished, O Indras,
for an evil-doing woman, the daughter of the heavens,
thou hast smitten; the growing daughter of the heaven,
the aurora, O Indras, thou hast destroyed; from the
chariot, broken in pieces, fell the aurora, trembling, because
the bull had struck her."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Here the mythical
animal reappears on the same stage with the heroes, and
for the image of the hero and the heroine there is substituted
that of the cow and the bull.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The sun and the aurora, therefore, do not always seek
each other from promptings of affection only, nor is the
hateful part always played by the aurora. The sun,
also appears as a perverse persecutor in his turn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>One Vedic hymn advises the aurora not to stretch
out the web she works at too far, lest the sun, like a
robber, with hostile intention, set fire to and burn
her.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Another hymn tells us that the handsome one
follows the beautiful one, the brother the sister, like a
lover,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>&mdash;the aurora fleeing from the sun, her brother, out
of shame, and her brother following her, actuated by a
brutal instinct. Finally, a third hymn shows us the
Vedic Vulcan, the blacksmith of the gods, the sun Tvash&#7789;ar,
called also the omniform sun (<i>Sâvitâ Viçvarûpah</i>), as
father of Sara&#7751;yû, another name for the aurora, omniform
herself, like her father (and, like the cow, undergoing the
triple transmutation at the hands of Tvash&#7789;ar, <i>i.e.</i>, the
three brothers, the &#7770;ibhavas), creating another form of
himself, that is, the sun <i>Vivasvant</i>, to be able to espouse
the aurora. Sara&#7751;yû, perceiving perhaps that Vivasvant
is her father under another shape, creates another woman
like herself, and flees away on the chariot that flies of
itself, and that was before given her by her father; and

himself into a horse.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>But sometimes the alienation the sun and the aurora,
the young husband and wife, is not due to evil propensities
in themselves, but the decree of fate working through the
machinations of monsters. The two beautiful ones are at
bottom united by love and reciprocal gratitude; for now
it is the sun who delivers the aurora, and now the aurora
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>who liberates the sun; and we have already seen the
aurora making the ambrosial milk drop for the sun from
her cows, and the sun drawing up and delivering the cows
of the aurora. There is a hymn in which the divine
girl, the aurora, comes up in the east, with a lascivious
air, smiling, fresh, uncovering her bosom, resplendent,
towards the god who sacrifices himself,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> that is to say,
towards the sun, towards <i>Çunahçepas</i> (the sun), who,
in three verses of another hymn,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> invokes her, the well-known
legend of which, narrated in the <i>Âitareya-Brâhma&#7751;am</i>,
I shall briefly relate. The aurora has also
the merit of having, with her pure and purifying light,
opened the gates of the gloomy cavern, discomfited the
enemies, the shades of night, and exposed to view the
treasures hidden by the darkness (and here we have Medea
again, but this time in a benignant form); she awakens
to activity the sleepers and everything with life (and
therefore, among the living sleepers, the sun, her son,
whom one of the hymns represents as sleeping profoundly
in the bosom of the darkness of night); she is the saviour
of mortals,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> that is to say, she protects mortals from
death, and resuscitates them; she sees and foresees everything.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
The awakener is also the awakened; the illuminator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>is also the illumined, or the wise; and the illumined
or luminous one is also the beautiful one. From
being small, she is become large<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> (the heroes and heroines
of mythology are only small at birth, and pass at once
into fulness of stature); from being infirm and sombre-visaged,
by the grace of Indras and of the Açvinâu, she
is cured and restored to strength and clearness.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> But why
was she dark at first? Because her mother, the night, is
the black one; she, the white one, is born of the black
one.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>During the night, the young girl was blind, and she
recovers her sight by the grace of a wise one, one who,
protected by Indras, another shape of Indras, has become
enamoured of her. We have seen above that it is the
Açvinâu who, with the aurora, give back to the sun his
sight; here it is the sun who makes the aurora see, it is
the sun who gives her light; and she who, having been
blind, recovers her sight, becomes the protectress of the
blind and preserver of vision,<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> like St Lucia, virgin and
martyr, in the Christian Mythology. Physical truth and
the mythical narration are in perfect accordance.</p>

<p>The night is now the mother, now the sister of the
aurora; but the gloomy night is sometimes her step-mother,
sometimes her half-sister. There is a riddle
which celebrates the luminous night and the aurora, as
two diversely beautiful ones who go together, but of whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>one goes while the other comes.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Another hymn sings
of them thus: "The brilliantly-decked one approaches,
the white aurora comes; the black one prepares for her
her rooms. The one immortal having joined the other, the
two appear alternately in the heavens. One and eternal
is the path of the two sisters; they follow it, one after
the other, guided by the gods; they do not meet, and
they never stand still&mdash;the two good nurses, night and
aurora, one in soul yet different in form."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> The two
good nurses, night and aurora, whose hues alternate
eternally, nourish between them one and the same child
(the sun).<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> But the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> itself tells us that the
night is not always the legitimate sister of the aurora;
the latter "abandons now the one that is, now the one
that is not, properly its sister."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Here probably we must
understand by the proper sister of the aurora the
luminous or moonlight night, and by the half-sister, the
gloomy night, the night without a moon. This is the
sister whom, in a hymn, the aurora removes, sends far
away from her, while she shines to be seen of her husband;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
and her half-sister, the night, is obliged to
resign her place to her elder or better sister,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> the
word <i>&#501;yesh&#7789;has</i> meaning not only the eldest, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>best. We have already seen that the aurora is the first
to appear; as such, and as she who in the evening precedes
the night (the evening aurora), she is the first-born,
the eldest, the most experienced, the best; while, from
another point of view, she is represented to us as the
little one who becomes great, and, in this case, as younger
sister of the night (the morning dawn). The dawns,
or auroras, are saluted with the epithet of workwomen,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
just as the good sister, with respect to the bad one, is
always she who works, doing wonderful work, that is,
spinning or weaving the rosy cloth. But the auroras are
not only the workers, they are also the pure purifying
and cleansing ones;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> hence one can understand how one
of the tasks imposed upon the youngest sister was that of
purifying, purging, or separating the grain during the
night, taking from it all that is impure, in which task
she is assisted sometimes by a good fairy, sometimes by
the Virgin Mary, who, according to all probability, is the
moon.</p>

<p>One of the singular qualities of the younger sister is
that she displays her beauty only before the eyes of her
husband. The wife aurora manifests herself in the
sight of her husband;<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> united, in her splendour, with the
rays of the sun,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> like a wife she prepares the dwelling
of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Very brilliant, like a wife cleansed by her
mother, she uncovers her body;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> like a bather who shows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>herself, the shining one unveils her body;<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> she adorns
herself like a dancer, uncovering, like a cow, her breast;<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
she displays her luminous garments;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> all-radiant, with
beautiful face, she laughs;<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and he who has made the
aurora laugh, her, the beautiful princess, who, at first, that
is, during the night, did not laugh, espouses her; the sun
espouses the aurora.</p>

<p>The celestial nuptials take place, and the ceremony is
minutely described in the 85th hymn of the 10th book
of the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>. But the marriage of the two celestials
is never consummated except under conditions; these
conditions are always accepted and afterwards forgotten,
and it is now the husband who, by forsaking his wife,
now the wife who, by abandoning her husband, violates
the promise given. One of these estrangements, these
temporary alienations of husband and wife, is described
in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> by the poetical myth of the dawn <i>Urvaçî</i>
and her husband <i>Purûravas</i>, one of the names given to
the sun. Urvaçî says of herself, "I have arrived like the
first of the auroras;"<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> thereupon Urvaçî suddenly abandons
her husband Purûravas, because he breaks an agreement
made between them. We shall see further on in
this chapter what this agreement was. Besides, having
given him a son before her departure, she consoles him
by permitting him to come and find her again in heaven,
that is, by endowing the sun with the immortality she
possesses herself. In the morning the aurora precedes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>the sun; he follows her too closely, and she disappears,
but leaves a son, <i>i.e.</i>, the new sun. In the evening the
aurora precedes the sun; he follows her again, and she
loses herself, now in a forest, now in the sea. The same
phenomenon, a divorce of husband from wife, or a separation
of brother and sister, or the flight of a sister from
her brother, or again, that of a daughter from her father,
presents itself twice every day (and every year) in the sky.
Sometimes, on the other hand, it is a witch, or the
monster of nocturnal darkness, who takes the place of the
radiant bride, or the aurora, near the sun; and in that
case the aurora, the beauteous bride, is spirited away into
a wood to be killed or thrown into the sea, from both of
which predicaments, however, she always escapes. Sometimes
the witch of night throws the brother and sister,
the mother and son, the sun and the aurora, together
into the waves of the sea, whence they both escape again,
to reappear in the morning.</p>

<p>All these alternative variations of a mythical representation
become each in turn a legend by itself, as we shall
see again more in detail, when the study of the different
animals that take part in them shall furnish us with
opportunities of doing so. In the meantime, we have
here finished our enumeration of all that in the hymns of
the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> refers in any way to the bull and the cow,&mdash;to
the wind, moon, and sun bulls, to the cow-cloud, moon,
spring and aurora,&mdash;leaving it, however, to be understood
how natural it is to pass from the bull to the handsome
hero-prince, and from the cow to the beautiful girl, the
rich princess, the valiant heroine, or the wise fairy. For
though in the mythical hymns of the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> we have
little more than hints or foreshadows of the many popular
legends which we have thus referred to, often without
naming them, these are so many and so precise that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
seems to me to be almost impossible not to recognise
them. To demonstrate this, however, it will be necessary
for me to show further what form the mythological ideas
and figures relating to the animals dispersed in the Vedic
hymns afterwards assumed in the Hindoo traditions.</p>

the study of the myth and of the legends which refer to the bull
and the cow of India.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just as the importance of the cattle to primitive and
pastoral Aryan life explains the propensity of the Aryan
mind to conceive of the mobile phenomena of the heavens,
at first considered living beings, as bulls and cows, so the
consecration of these animals, associated and identified
with the celestial phenomena and the gods, naturally gave
rise to the superstitious worship of the bull and the cow,
common to all the Aryan nations, but particularly, through
the intervention of the brâhmanic priests, to the Hindoos.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the words <i>v&#7771;ishas</i>, <i>v&#7771;ishabhas</i>,
and <i>&#7771;ishabhas</i>, which mean the bull as the one who
pours out, the <i>f&#339;cundator</i>, is often used in Sanscrit to
denote the best, the first, the prince; and hence the bull,
that is to say, the best <i>f&#339;cundator</i>, is in India the most
sacred symbol of royalty. For this reason the phallic
and destroying god, the royal <i>Çivas</i>, who inhabits <i>Gokar&#7751;as</i>
(a word which properly means cow's ear), has both
for his steed and his emblem a brâhmanic bull, <i>i.e.</i>, a bull
with a hunch on its back; the <i>nandin</i>, or joyful attribute,
being given to Çivas himself, inasmuch as, being the <i>Deus
phallicus</i>, he is the god of joyfulness and beatitude.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Still more honour is paid to the cow (like the Vedic
dawn <i>anavadyâ</i>, innocent or inculpable<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>), which therefore
it was a crime to kill.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> An interesting chapter of the
<i>Âitareya-brâhma&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> on the sacrifice of animals, shows
us how, next to man, the horse was the supreme sacrifice
offered to the gods; how the cow afterwards took the place
of the horse; the sheep, of the cow; the goat, of the
sheep; and, at last, vegetable products were substituted
for animals;&mdash;a substitution or cheating of the gods in
the sacrifice, which, perhaps, serves to explain even more
the fraud of which, in popular stories, the simpleton is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>always the victim; the simpleton here being the god himself,
and the cheater man, who changes, under a sacred
pretext, the noblest and most valued animals for common
and less valuable ones, and finally for vegetables apparently
of no value whatever. In the Hindoo codes of law we
have the same fraudulent substitution of animals under a
legal pretext. "The killer of a cow," says the code attributed
to <i>Yâ&#501;&#324;avalkyas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> "must stay a month in penitence,
drinking the <i>pa&#324;&#263;agavyam</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the five good
productions of the cow, which, according to Manus,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> are
milk, curds, butter, urine, and dung), sleeping in a stable
and following the cows; and he must purify himself by
the gift of another cow." Thus, according to <i>Yâ&#501;&#324;avalkya</i>,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
the killer of a parrot is purified by giving a two-year-old
calf; the killer of a crane by giving a calf three
years old; the killer of an ass, a goat, or a sheep, by the
gift of a bull; the killer of an elephant by the gift of five
black bulls (<i>nîlav&#7771;ishâp</i>). And one need not be astonished
to find these contracts (which remind one of that
between Jacob and Laban) in the Hindoo codes of law,
when, in the Vedic hymns themselves, a poet offers to
sell to whoever will buy it, an Indras of his, that is to
say, a bull, for ten cows.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Another interesting verse of
<i>Yâ&#501;&#324;avalkyas</i><a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> tells us they die pure who are killed by
lightning or in battle for the sake of the cows or the
brâhmans. The cow was often the object heroes fought
for in heaven; the Brâhman wished to be the object
heroes should fight for upon earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>We learn from the domestic ceremonies referred to
by <i>G&#7771;ihyasûtrâni</i> with how much respect the bull and
the cow were treated as the symbols of abundance in a
family. In <i>Âçvalâyanas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> we find the bull's hide
stretched out near the nuptial hearth, the wife seated
upon it, and the husband, touching his wife, saying,
"May the lord of all creatures allow us to have children;"&mdash;words
taken from the Vedic nuptial hymn.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> We have
seen above how the &#7770;ibhavas, from the hide of a dead
cow, formed a new and beautiful one, or, in other words,
how, from the dusk of evening, by stretching it in the
night, they formed the dawn of morning. This cow's hide
plays also an important <i>rôle</i> in the popular faith; an
extraordinary elasticity is attributed to it, a power of
endless expansibility, and for this reason it is adopted
as a symbol of fecundity, upon which the wife must
place herself in order to become a mother of children.
The cow's hide (<i>go&#263;arman</i>), in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> is
the garment of the god Vish&#7751;us; and the go&#263;arman
divided into thongs, and afterwards fastened to each
other, served formerly in India to measure the circumference
of a piece of ground;<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> hence the cow's hide suggested
the idea of a species of infinity. Further on we shall
find it put to extraordinary uses in western legend; we
find it even in the hymns of the Vedic age used to cover
the body of a dead man, the fire being invoked not to
consume it, almost as if the cow's hide had the virtue of
resuscitating the dead.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>The cow, being the symbol of fruitfulness, was also the
companion of the wife during pregnancy. <i>Âçvalâya&#7751;as</i><a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
tells us how, in the third month, the husband was to give
his wife to drink of the sour milk of a cow that has a
calf like itself, and in it two beans and a grain of barley;
the husband was then to ask his wife three times, "What
drinkest thou?" and she was to answer three times:
"The generation of males." In the fourth month, the
wife, according to <i>Âçvalâya&#7751;as</i>, was to put herself again
upon the bull's hide, near the fire of sacrifice, when they
again invoked the god <i>Pra&#501;âpatis</i>, lord of all creatures,
or of procreation; the moon, like a celestial bull and
cow, was invited to be present at the generation of men;<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
and a bull, during the Vedic period, was the gift which
sufficed for the priest. In the Vedic antiquity, neither
bulls nor cows were allowed to go to pasture without
some special augury, which, in the domestic ceremonials
of <i>Âçvalâya&#7751;as</i>,<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> has been also handed down to us; the
cows were to give milk and honey, for the strength and
increase of whoever possessed them. Here we have again
the cows not only as the beneficent, but as the strong
ones, they who help the hero or the heroine who takes
them to pasture.</p>

<p>But although beautiful cows, when seen by day, are a
sign of good luck, seen in dreams they are of evil omen;
for in that case they are of course the black cows, the
shadows of night, or the gloomy waters of the nocturnal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>ocean. Already in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, the dawn, or the
luminous cow, comes to deliver the fore-mentioned solar
hero, Tritas Aptyas, from the evil sleep which he sleeps
amidst the cows<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> of night. <i>Âçvalâya&#7751;as</i>, in his turn,
recommends us when we have an evil dream, to invoke
the sun, to hasten the approach of the morning, or, better
still, to recite the hymn of five verses to the dawn which
we have already referred to, and which begins with the
words, "And like an evil dream amidst the cows." Here
the belief is not yet an entirely superstitious one; and
we understand what is meant by the cows who envelop
us in the sleep of night, when we are told to invoke the
sun and the dawn to come and deliver us from them.</p>

<p>A cow (probably a black one), often a black goat,
was sometimes also sacrificed in the funeral ceremonies of
the Hindoos, as if to augur that, just as the black cow,
night, produces the milky humours of the aurora, or is
fruitful, so will he who has passed through the kingdom
of darkness rise again in the world of light. We have
already seen the black night as the mother of the white
and luminous aurora; I quote below yet another Vedic
sentence, in which a poet ingenuously wonders why the
cows of Indras, the black ones as well as the light-coloured
(the black clouds, as well as the white and red
ones), should both yield white milk.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> And even the
gloomy nocturnal kingdom of Yamas, the god of the
dead, has its cows of black appearance, which are nevertheless
milk-yielding; and thus the black cow of the
funeral sacrifices comes to forebode resurrection.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>In the same way the viaticum, or provision of food for
his journey, given to the dead man is a symbol of his
resurrection. The journey being considered as a short
one, the provision of food which is to sustain the traveller
to the kingdom of the dead is limited, and each dead hero
carries it with him, generally not so much for himself, as
to ensure a passage into the kingdom of the dead. For
this reason we read, even in the domestic ceremonials
of <i>Âçvalâya&#7751;as</i>, that it is recommended to put into the
hands of the dead man,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> what is the greatest symbol of
strength, the reins of the animal killed in the funeral
sacrifice (or, in default of an animal victim, at least two
cakes of rice or of flour), in order that the dead man may
throw them down the throats of the two Cerberi, the two
sons of the bitch <i>Saramâ</i>, so that they may let the
deceased enter scatheless into the death-kingdom, the
mysterious kingdom of Yamas; and here we find the
monster of the popular tales, into whose house the hero,
having passed through many dangers, enters, by the
advice of a good fairy or of a good old man, giving
something to appease the hunger of the two dogs who
guard its gate.</p>

<p>They who return from the funeral must touch the
stone of Priapus, a fire, the excrement of a cow,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> a grain
of barley, a grain of sesame and water,&mdash;all symbols of
that fecundity which the contact with a corpse might
have destroyed.</p>

<p>The Vedic hymns have shown us the principal mythical
aspects and functions of the cow and the bull; we have
also seen how the brâhmanic codes confirmed, by the
sanction of law, the worship of these animals, and how
jealously the domestic tradition of the Hindoos has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>guarded it. Let us now see from the <i>Âitareya-brâhma&#7751;am</i>,
how the Brâhmans themselves, those of the
era immediately following that of the Vedâs, interpreted
the myth of the cow.</p>

<p>We have recognised in the Vedic heavens, as reflected
in the hymns of the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, three cows&mdash;the cow-cloud,
the cow-moon, and the cow-aurora. These three cows,
and especially the first and the third, are also quite distinct
from one another in the <i>Âitareya-brâhma&#7751;am</i>.</p>

<p>It tells us how the <i>gâuh p&#7771;içnih</i>, the variegated cow,
or spotted cow, of the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, must be celebrated to
make the earth fruitful<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> (or that one must sing to the
cloud that it may fertilise the pastures and fields with
rain), and how one must sacrifice a bull to <i>Viçvakarman</i>
(or the one that does all), who is transformed into the
god Indras when killing the demon V&#7771;itras,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> or the monster
who keeps the rain in the cloud.</p>

<p>It shows us the full moon, <i>Râkâ</i>, joined to the aurora,
as a source of abundance,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and the aurora with the
cow.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> It tells us explicitly that the characteristic form
of the aurora is the red cow, because she moves with
the red cows.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The gods, after having discovered
the cows in the cavern, open the cavern with the third
libation of the morning;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> when the cows come out, the
gods, the <i>Âdityâs</i>, also come out; hence the coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>forth of the gods (<i>Âdityânâm ayanam</i>) is equivalent to
the coming forth of the cows (<i>gavâm ayanam</i>). The
cows come out when they have their horns, and adorn
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The aurora is a cow; this cow has horns; her horns
are radiant and golden. When the cow aurora comes
forth, all that falls from her horns brings good luck;
hence in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> the benefits received from
a holy hermit, called Matañgas, are compared to those of
a <i>gavâm ayanam</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a coming out of cows. To understand
this simile, besides a reference to the Vedic texts,
it is necessary to compare it with the modern usages of
India, in which, in celebration of the new solar year, or
the birth of the pastoral god K&#7771;ish&#7751;as (the god who is
black during the night, but who becomes luminous in the
morning among the cows of the dawning, or among the
female cowherds), it is customary, towards the end of
December, to give cows to the Brâhmans, exchange presents
of cows and calves, besprinkle one another with
milk, to adorn a beautiful milch cow, crown her with
flowers, gild her horns, or paint them various colours, to
deck her to overloading with flowers, fruit, and little
cakes, and then hunt her from the village to the sound of
drums and trumpets, in order that, full of terror, she
may flee away with distraction and impetuosity. The
cow loses her ornaments in her flight, and these, being
estimated as propitious treasures, are eagerly picked up
by the faithful, and preserved as sacred relics.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Âitareya-brâhma&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> the sun is born of the
cows (<i>go&#501;â</i>), is the son of the cow aurora; as the sun's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>mother she naturally nourishes him with her milk; hence
the same <i>Âitareya</i><a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> tells us that the gods Mitras and
Varu&#7751;as, by means of the curdled milk, took from the
drink of the gods the inebriating poison which the long-tongued
witch (<i>Dîrgha&#501;ihvî</i>) had poured into it. This
curdled milk is the same milky sea, with health-giving
herbs scattered in it, and which the gods agitate to form
ambrosia, in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, and
the Puranic legends; a sea and herbs which we find
already spoken of together in a Vedic hymn.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> But in
the sky, where the ambrosial milk and the health-giving
herbs are produced, there are gods and demons; and the
milk, which is at one time the rain, at another ambrosia,
is now in the cloud, now in the moon (called also
<i>Oshadhipatis</i>, or lord of herbs), now round the dawn.
Hanumant, who, in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, goes in quest of
the health-giving grass to restore their souls to the half-dead
heroes, looks for it now between the mountain bull
(<i>&#7771;ishabhas</i>) and the heavenly mountain <i>Kâilasas</i>, now
between the Mount Lunus (<i>Çandras</i>) and the mountain
cup (<i>Dro&#7751;as</i>); and the mountain which possesses the
herb for which Hanumant is searching is itself called
herb (<i>oshadhis</i>), or the one that causes to rejoice with
perfumes (<i>Gandhamâdanas</i><a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>), which two words are used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>synonymously. Here the milky, ambrosial, and healthful
humour is supposed to be produced, not by a cow, but
by an herb. And the gods and demons contend in heaven
for the possession of this herb, as well as for the ambrosia;
the only difference being that the gods enjoy both one and
the other without corrupting them, whilst the demons
poison them as they drink them; that is to say, they
spread darkness over the light, they move about in the
darkness, in the gloomy waters, in the black humour
which comes out of the herb itself, which, in contact with
them, becomes poisonous, so that they in turn suck the
poison. On the other hand, the <i>Gandharvâs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> an amphibious
race, in whom at one time the nature of the gods
predominates, at another that of the demons, and who
consequently take now the side of the gods, now that of
the demons, are simply guards who, as against theft, keep
watch and ward over the perfumes and healthful herbs,
which are their own property, and the healthful or
ambrosial waters, the ambrosia which belongs to their
wives, the nymphs; they are, in a word, the earliest
representatives of the enjoying and jealous proprietor.
We have already heard, in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, the demoniacal
monsters call on each other to suck the poison of the
celestial cows; and we have seen that the <i>Âitareya-brâhma&#7751;am</i>
accuses a witch of being the poisoner of the
divine ambrosia; we have, moreover, noticed that a Vedic
hymn already associates together the ambrosial milk
and the healthful herb, and that, in the brâhmanic cosmogony,
the milk and the herb which produces it are
manifested together, which herb or grass is beneficent
or the reverse according as the gods or the demons enjoy
it; from all which it will be easy to understand this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
interesting Hindoo proverb, "The grass gives the milk
to the cows, and the milk gives the poison to the
serpents."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> It is indeed the milk of the cow of the
dawn and of the cow of the moon which destroys
the serpents of darkness, the demoniacal shadows of
night.</p>

<p>But the idea of the healthful herb is incorporated in
another image, very familiar to the popular Indo-European
legends, and which is contained even in the Vedic hymns.
The cow produces the sun and the moon; the circular
shape, the disc of sun and moon, suggests variously the
idea of a ring, a gem, and a pearl; and the sun, <i>Savitar</i>,
he who gives the juice, and the generator, is introduced in a
Vedic hymn, as the one who has immortal juice, who gives
the pearl.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The humours of the cow have passed to the
herb, and from the herb to the pearl; and the naturalness
of this figure recommends itself to our modern conception,
for when we would describe a diamond or other gem as of
the purest quality, we say it is a diamond or gem of the
first water. Even the pearl-moon and the pearl-sun, from
their ambrosial humours, have a fine water. In the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
at the moment of production of ambrosia from
the stirring up of the milky sea, we see, near the healthful
herb, the gem <i>Kâustubhas</i>, the same which we afterwards
find on the breast of the sun-god Vish&#7751;us, and which is
sometimes his navel; whence Vish&#7751;us, in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
is saluted by the name of <i>ratnanâbhas</i>&mdash;that is
to say, he who has a pearl for his navel; as the sun is in
like manner saluted by the name of <i>Ma&#7751;&#7883;ç&#7771;iñgas</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>who has horns of pearls.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> In the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> the
bright-shining grass and the solar disc appear together
on the summit of the mountain Gandhamâdanas; no
sooner does he smell its odour than the solar hero
<i>Lakshma&#7751;as</i>, delivered from the iron that oppressed him,
lifts himself up from the ground; <i>i.e.</i>, scarcely has the
sun formed his disc, and begun to shine like a celestial
gem, than the sun-hero, whom the monsters had vanquished
during the night, rises in victory. And it is
on the summit of the mountain that, with a mountain
metal of a colour similar to that of the young sun,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> the
sun <i>Râmas</i> imprints a dazzling mark on the forehead of
the dawn Sîtâ, as if to be able to recognise her&mdash;that is
to say, he places himself upon the forehead of the aurora
or dawn. When the sun Râmas is separated from the
dawn Sîtâ, he sends her in recognition, as a symbol of his
disc, his own ring, which appears again in the famous
ring given by King <i>Dushmantas</i> to the beautiful <i>Çakuntalâ</i>,
the daughter of the nymph, and by means of which
alone the lost bride can be recognised by the young and
forgetful king; and Sîtâ sends back to Râmas, by the
hands of Hanumant, as a sign of recognition, the dazzling
ornament which Râmas had one day placed upon her
forehead in an idyllic scene among the mountains known
to them alone. This ring of recognition, this magic
pearl, often turns up in the Hindoo legends. It is enough
for me to indicate here the two most famous examples.</p>

<p>The aurora who possesses the pearl becomes she who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>is rich in pearls, and herself a source of pearls; but the
pearl, as we have already seen, is not only the sun, it is
also the moon. The moon is the friend of the aurora;
she comforts her in the evening under her persecutions;
she loads her with presents during the night, accompanies
and guides her, and helps her to find her husband.</p>

<p>In the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, I frequently find the moon as a
beneficent fairy, who succours the dawn Sîtâ; for the
moon, as <i>ráganîkaras</i> (she who gives light to the night),
assumes a benignant aspect. We have already said that
the moon is generally a male in India; but as full moon
and new moon it assumes, even in the Vedic texts, a
feminine name. In a Vedic hymn, <i>Râkâ</i>, the full moon
is exhorted to sew the work with a needle that cannot be
broken.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Here we have the moon personified as a marvellous
workwoman, a fairy with golden fingers, a good
fairy; and in this character we find her again in the
<i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, under the form of the old <i>Anasûyâ</i>, who
anoints the darkened Sîtâ (for Sîtâ, like the Vedic girl, is
dark and ugly during the night, or winter, when she is
hidden) in the wood, with a divine unguent; gives her a
garland, various ornaments, and two beauteous garments,
which are always pure (as, <i>i.e.</i>, they do not touch the
earth, like the cows of the Vedic dawn, who do not cover
themselves with dust), and similar in colour to the young
sun;<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> in all which the fairy moon appears as working
during the night for the aurora, preparing her luminous
garments&mdash;the two garments, of which the one is for the
evening and the other for the morning, one lunar and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>silver, the other solar and of gold&mdash;in order that she may
please her husband Râmas, or the sun Vish&#7751;us, who is
glad when he sees her thus adorned. In the <i>Svayamprabhâ</i>,
too, we meet with the moon as a good fairy, who,
from the golden palace which she reserves for her friend
Hemâ (the golden one), is during a month the guide, in
the vast cavern, of Hanumant and his companions, who
have lost their way in the search of the dawn Sîtâ. To
come out of this cavern, it is necessary to shut the eyes,
in order not to see its entrance; all Hanumant's companions
are come out, but Taras, who shines like the
moon,<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> would wish to return. The same moon can be
recognised in the benignant fairies <i>Tri&#501;âtâ</i>, <i>Suramâ</i>,
and <i>Saramâ</i>, who announce to Sîtâ that her husband
will soon arrive, and that she will soon see him. The
first, while the arrival of Râmas is imminent, dreams
that the monsters, dressed in yellow, are playing in a
lake of cow's milk;<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> at the time when Suramâ announces
to Sîtâ the approach of Râmas, Sîtâ shines by her own
beauty, like the opening dawn;<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> finally, Saramâ (who
seems to be the same as Suramâ), whom Sîtâ calls her
twin-sister (<i>sahodarâ</i>), penetrating underground, like
the moon Proserpine, also announces to Sîtâ her approaching
deliverance at the hands of Râmas.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> As to
Tri&#501;a&#7789;â, it is not difficult to recognise in her the moon,
when we remember that Tr&#501;ia&#7789;as is a name which is
frequently given to the evening sun, or rising moon, <i>Çivas</i>,
who is represented with the moon for a diadem, whence his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>other name of <i>Çandra&#263;û&#7693;as</i> (having the moon for his diadem).
Suramâ I believe to be, not a mythical, but only an
orthographical variation, and more incorrect one, of Saramâ,
whose relation to the moon we shall see in detail when
we come to the chapter which treats of the mythical dog.</p>

<p>Thus far we have a moon fairy; but we find the moon
designated at other times in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> by its common
masculine name. The guardian of the forest of
honey, <i>Dadhimukhas</i>, in which forest, with its honey, the
heroes who accompany Sîtâ enjoy themselves, is said to
be generated by the god Lunus.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> And the moon, who
assists Hanumant in his search of Sîtâ, is said to shine
like a white bull with a sharpened horn, with a full horn;<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
in which we come back to the moon as a horned animal,
and to the cornucopia. Moreover, we find the same lunar
horn again in the city of <i>Ç&#7771;iñgaveram</i>, where first the
solar hero Râmas, and afterwards his brother Bharatas,
are hospitably received when the sun is darkened,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> by
<i>Guhas</i>, king of the black <i>Wishâdâs</i>, who also is of the
colour of a black cloud;<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and Râmas and Bharatas take
their departure in the morning from Guhas, who is said
to wander always in the forests.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Now, this Guhas, who,
though always hidden, yet wishes to entertain the solar
hero during the night with presents of the town of
Ç&#7771;iñgaveram, appears to me to be just another form of
the solar hero himself, who enters and hides himself in the
night, hospitably received in the lunar habitation, another
form of the god Indras, whom we have seen in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>united during the night to Indus or Somas&mdash;that is, to
the moon&mdash;and who, in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i><a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>, when Sîtâ is
in the power of the monster, comes down during the
night to console her, lulls her keepers to sleep, and
nourishes her with the ambrosial milk (with Soma, the
moon, the same moon which, in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, the dawn,
the girl beloved of Indras, and whom therefore he does
good to, brings him as a present), encouraging her with
the prospect of the near advent of Râmas, the deliverer.</p>

<p>But it remains to us to adduce clearer evidence to show
that in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> Râmas is the sun, and Sîtâ the
dawn, or aurora.</p>

<p>Without taking into account that Râmas is the most
popular personification of Vish&#7751;us, and that Vish&#7751;us is
often the solar hero (although he is not seldom identified
with the moon), let us see how Râmas manifests himself,
and what he does in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> to vindicate especially
his solar nature.</p>

<p>It is my opinion that the best way to prove this is to
show how Râmas performs the very same miracles that Indras
does. Râmas, like Indras, gives, while still young,
extraordinary proofs of his strength; Râmas, like Indras,
achieves his greatest enterprises while he is himself
hidden; Râmas, like Indras, vanquishes the monster,
reconquers Sîtâ, and enjoys of right the company of his
wife. Till Râmas goes into the forests, as Indras into
the clouds and shadows, his great epopee does not begin.
Indras has for assistants the winds (the Marutas); Râmas
has for his greatest help Hanumant, the son of the wind
(<i>Mârutâtmagah</i>);<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Hanumant amuses himself with the
monsters, as the wind with the archer-clouds of the
thousand-eyed Indras;<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and it is said that Râmas gets on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Hanumant's back, as Indras does on the elephant <i>Âiravatas</i>.
The elephant with a proboscis is not unfrequently
substituted, in the brâhmanic tradition, for the horned
bull of the Vedâs.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> But the bull Indras is reproduced in
the bull Râmas, and the monkeys who assist Râmas have
kept at least the tail of the Vedic cows, the helpers of
Indras, whence their generic name of <i>golâñgulâs</i> (who
have cows' tails).<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> The bow with which Râmas shoots the
monsters is made of a horn, whence his name of <i>Çârngadhanvant</i>
(he who shoots with the horn);<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Râmas receives
the shower of hostile darts, as a bull upon its horns
the abundant rains of autumn.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> Sîtâ herself calls both
her Râmas and his brother Lakshma&#7751;as by the name of
<i>si&#7751;harshabhâu</i>,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> or the lion and the bull, which are conjoined
so frequently in the mythology, on account of
equal strength; hence the terror of the lion when he hears
the bull bellow in the first book of the <i>Pa&#324;&#263;atantram</i>,
and in all the numerous Eastern and Western variations
of that book. Indras has his conflicts in the cloudy,
rainy, and gloomy sky; these are also the battle-fields of
Râmas. The names of the monsters of the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,
as, for instance, <i>Vidyu&#501;&#501;ivas</i> (he who lives upon thunderbolts),
<i>Va&#501;rodarî</i> (she who has thunderbolts in her
stomach), <i>Indra&#501;it</i> (who vanquishes Indras with magical
arts), <i>Meghanâdas</i> (thundering cloud),<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and others, show
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>us the nature of the battle. In the battle-field of Râmas,
instead, the assisting hero is now a bull (<i>&#7771;ishabhas</i>), now
an ox's eye (<i>gavâkshas</i>), now <i>gavayas</i> (<i>bos gav&#339;us</i>), and
beings of similar appellations, which remind us of the
Vedic deities. Indras strikes with lightning the celestial
ocean; Râmas, an Indian Xerxes, chastises the sea with
burning arrows.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> Indras, in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, crosses the
sea and passes ninety-nine rivers; Râmas crosses the
ocean upon a bridge of mountains, in carrying which
Hanumant, the son of the wind, shows himself peculiarly
skilful; the winds carry the clouds, which we have seen,
in the language of the Vedâs, represented as mountains.
And that clouds, and not real mountains, are here spoken
of, we deduce from observing, as we read, that while the
animal army of Râmas carries the bridge on to the ocean,
or the winds carry the clouds into the sky, the sun cannot
burn the weary monkey-workers, because that clouds
arise and cover it, rain falls, and the wind expires.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The
field of this epic battle is evidently the same as that of
the mythical battle of Indras. And in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>
we find at every step the similarity of the combatants to
the dark clouds, the bellowing clouds, the clouds carried
by the wind. The forest which Râmas goes through is
compared to a group of clouds.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The name of wanderer
by night (<i>ra&#501;anî&#263;aras</i>), afterwards given frequently in
the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, to the monster whom Râmas combats,
implies, of course, that the battle is fought by night.
The fact that, as we read, the witch <i>Çûrpa&#7751;akhâ</i> comes
in winter to seduce Râmas whilst he is in the forest,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>the monster <i>Kumbhakar&#7751;as</i> awakens after six months'
sleep, like a rainy cloud which increases towards the end
of summer (<i>tapânte</i>),<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> shows us that the epic poem of
Râmas embraces, besides the nightly battle of the sun
over darkness, also the great annual battle of the sun in
winter to recover and rejoin the spring. Anyhow, it is
always a battle of the sun against the monster of darkness.
Râmas, in the very beginning of the great poem,
says to his brother Lakshma&#7751;as:&mdash;"See, O Lakshma&#7751;as,
Mâri&#263;as is come here with his followers, making a noise
like thunder, and with him the wanderer by night
Subâhus; thou wilt see them to-day, like a mass of
dark clouds, dispersed by me in a moment, like clouds
by the wind."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Here we find almost the whole battle of
Indras.</p>

<p>And similar battles in the clouds are found in several
other episodes of the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>. The dart of Râmas
falls upon the monster <i>Kharas</i> (the monster ass), as upon
a great tree falls the thunderbolt hurled by Indras.<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
Heroes and monsters combat with stones and rocks from
the great mountain, and fall, overthrown on the earth,
like mountains. The monster Râva&#7751;as carries off Sîtâ
with the magic of the wind and the tempest.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Heroes
and monsters fight with trunks of trees from the great
forest; moreover, the trunks themselves, having become
monsters, join the fray, stretch out their strange arms,
and devour the hero in their cavities. And here we come
upon the interesting legend of <i>Kabandhas</i>, in which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>find again the forests and trees combating, and the barrel
of the Vedâs carried by the divine bull. The <i>Dânavâs</i>
or demons also appear, in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> in the
forms of sounding barrels. In the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, the
highest of the demons (<i>dânavottamah</i>) is called by the
name of <i>Kabandhas</i> (barrel and trunk), compared to a
black thundering cloud, and represented as an enormous
trunk, having one large yellowish eye, and an enormous
devouring mouth in his chest.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> In Tuscany, we say of
water that gushes copiously out of a reservoir, that it
pours as from a barrel's mouth. The monster Kabandhas
draws towards himself, with his long arms, the two brothers
Râmas and Lakshma&#7751;as (compared several times in the
<i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i><a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> to the two Açvinâu, who resemble each
other in everything). Râmas and Lakshma&#7751;as, <i>i.e.</i>, the
two Açvinâu, the morning and evening, the spring and
autumn suns, the two twilights, who, in a passage of the
<i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, are called the two ears of Râmas, cut off the
two extremities, the two long arms, of the monster <i>Kabandhas</i>;
upon which the trunk, able no longer to support
itself, falls to the ground. The fallen monster then relates
to the two brothers that he was once a beautiful demon;
but that, by a malediction, Indras one day made his head
and legs enter his body; his arms having been lacerated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>by the two brothers, the monster is disenchanted from this
malediction, and having resumed his form of a splendid
demon, he ascends to heaven in a luminous form. Here
we have the all-radiant sun shut up in the cloud, he being
the yellow eye, the burning mouth, of Kabandhas, and, in
union with the cloud, forming a hideous monster; the
hero comes to destroy his monstrous form, and the monster
thanks him, for thus he becomes the glorious god,
the splendid being, the handsome prince he was before.
Râmas who delivers Kabandhas from his monstrous
form by cutting off his two arms, is the sun Râmas
coming forth from the gloomy forest, and uncovering the
sky in the east and in the west. Râmas delivering
Kabandhas is simply the sun delivering himself from
the monster of gloom and cloud that envelops him. And,
indeed, the greater part of the myths have their origin in
the plurality of appellations given to the same phenomenon.
Each appellation grows into a distinct personality,
and the various personalities fight with each other.
Hence the hero who delivers himself becomes the deliverer
of the hero, viewed as a different person from the hero;
the monstrous form which envelops the hero is often
his own malediction; the hero who comes to kill this
monstrous form is his benefactor.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>This theory of the monster who thanks the hero that
kills him, agrees with what we find on several other
occasions in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, as in the case of the stag
<i>Marî&#263;as</i>,<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> which, after being killed by Râmas, re-ascends
to heaven in a luminous form; of the sea-monster, which
Hanumant destroys, and restores to its primitive form,
that of a celestial nymph; of the old Çavarî, who, after
having seen Râmas, sacrifices herself in the fire, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>re-ascends young and beautiful to heaven (the usual Vedic
young girl, the dawn whom, ugly during the night,
Indras, by taking off her ugly skin, restores to beauty in
the morning); an episodical variation of what afterwards
happens to Sîtâ herself, who, having been ugly when in
the power of the monster Râva&#7751;as, recovers her beauty
by the sacrifice of fire, in order to prove her innocence to
her husband Râmas, and shines again a young girl, like
the young sun, adorned with burning gold, and wearing a
red dress;<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and when Râmas comes near (like the young
dawn, when she sees her husband), she resembles the
first light (Prabhâ), the wife of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> This Sîtâ,
daughter of &#500;anakas (the generator), whom the <i>Tâittiriya
Brâhma&#7751;am</i> calls Savitar<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> or the sun, seems to me to
be no other than the dawn, the daughter of light, the
daughter of Indras, the god of the Vedic texts. These,
indeed, sometimes represent Sûryâ, the daughter of the
sun, as the lover of the moon (who is then masculine);
but we find more frequently the loves of the dawn and
the sun, of the beautiful heroine and the splendid solar
hero, while the moon is generally the brother, or the pitying
sister of the hero and the heroine, the beneficent old
man, the foreseeing fairy, the good hostess, who aids
them in their enterprises; although we also find the dawn
as a sister of the sun and his succourer. In fact, the
Buddhist tradition of the legend of Râmas, illustrated by
Weber,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> represents Sîtâ to us as the sister of the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>brothers Râmas and Lakshma&#7751;as, who go into banishment
for twelve years to escape the persecutions of
their cruel step-mother (of whom the <i>Kâikeyî</i> of the
<i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> offers a confused image), in the same way
as the Vedic dawn is united to the twin Açvinâu; and
the same tradition makes Râmas, at the termination of
his exile, end with marrying his own sister Sîtâ, as the sun
marries the dawn. And the fact of Sîtâ being not born
from the womb, but produced from the ground, a girl of
heavenly beauty, destined to be the reward of valour,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
not only does not exclude her relationship with the dawn,
but confirms it; for we have seen the dawn rise from the
mountain, as the daughter of light and the sun, whom
the young sun wins for his bride, as a reward for his
wonderful skill as an archer against the monsters of darkness;
and we have seen that the dawn marries only her
predestined husband, and her predestined husband is he
who performs the greatest miracles, restores her lost
gaiety, and most resembles her. We have just seen the
old Çavarî and the ugly Sîtâ, at the sight of the sun
Râmas, deliver themselves in the fire from every mortal
danger, and become beautiful and happy once more.</p>

<p>But the concord between the mythical husband and
wife is not more steadfast than that of mortal couples.
Râmas is very apt to be suspicious. Having returned to
his kingdom of Ayodhyâ, he allows himself to brood upon
what his subjects may say of him for having taken back
his wife, after she had been in the hands of the monster
(they were not present at the first fire-sacrifice of Sîtâ);
Râmas reveals his suspicions to Sîtâ, and blames the evil-speaking
of the citizens for originating them; she submits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
a second time to the trial by fire, but, offended by
his continual suspicions, she flees from her husband, and
on a car of light, drawn by serpents (<i>Pannagâs</i>), goes
down again underground (which appears to mean simply
this&mdash;the dawn, or spring, marries the sun in the morning,
or she stays all day, or all summer, in his kingdom,
and in the evening, or in the autumn, goes down into
the shades of night, or of winter).<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> It is an indiscretion
of the husband which causes his wife to abandon him.</p>

<p>Thus, in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, we have seen <i>Urvaçî</i>, the first
of the dawns, flee from the sun <i>Purûravas</i>. In <i>Somadevas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
the king Purûravas loses his wife Urvaçî, because
he has let it be known in heaven that she was with him;
in Kâlidâsas's drama of <i>Vikramorvaçî</i>, the king Purûravas,
having helped Indras in the fight, receives from
him Urvaçî to wife, with whom he engages to stay till a
child is born to them; the king, shortly after having
espoused Urvaçî, looks at another nymph, Udakavatî (the
watery). Urvaçî, offended, flees; she enters a wood to
hide herself, and is transformed into a creeper. In the
brâhmanic tradition of the <i>Ya&#289;urvedas</i>, referred to at
length by Professor Max Müller, in his "Oxford Essays,"
Purûravas loses sight of Urvaçî, because he has let himself
be seen by her without his regal dress, or even
naked.</p>

<p>We find yet another similar legend in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
The wise and splendid Çântanus goes to the chase
on the banks of the Gañgâ, and there finds a beautiful
nymph whom he becomes enamoured of. The nymph
responds to his suit, and consents to remain with him,
on condition that he will never say anything displeasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>to her, whatever she may do or meditate; and the
enamoured king assents to the grave condition. They
live together happily, for the king yields to the nymph
in everything; but in the course of time, eight sons are
born to them; the nymph has already thrown seven into
the river, and the king, although inwardly full of grief,
dares not say anything to her; but when she is about to
throw the last one in, the king implores her not to do it,
and challenges her to say who she is. The nymph then
confesses to him that she is the Gañgâ itself personified,
and that the eight sons born to their loves are human
personifications of the eight divine Vasavas, who, by
being thrown into the Gañgâ, are liberated from the
curse of the human form: the only Vasus who is pleased
to remain among men is Dyâus (the sky), in the form of
the eunuch Bhîshmas, whom Çântanus would not allow
to be thrown into the waters. The same curse falls upon
the Vasavas for having ravished the cow of abundance
from the penitent Apavas. We shall find a legendary
subject analogous to this one of Çântanus in several of
the popular tales of Europe, with this difference that, in
European tradition, it is generally the husband who
abandons his indiscreet partner. The Hindoo tradition,
however, also offers us an example of the husband who
abandons his wife, in the wise &#500;aratkarus, who marries
the sister of the king of the serpents, on condition that
she never does anything to displease him.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> One day the
wise man sleeps; evening comes on; he ought to be
awakened in order to say his evening prayers; if he does
not say them, he does not do his duty, and she would do
wrong did she not warn him. If she awaken him, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
will be enraged. What is to be done? She takes the
latter course. The wise man awakes, becomes enraged, and
abandons her, after she had given him a son.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>The glowing aspect of the sky, morning and evening,
suggested the idea, now of a splendid nuptial feast, now of
a fire. In this fire, sometimes the witch who persecutes
the hero and heroine is burnt, and sometimes the hero
and heroine themselves are immolated. The sacrifice of
Çavarî and of Sîtâ, who are delivered by the sun Râmas,
is only a variation of that of Çuna&#7717;çepas, liberated by the
dawn in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>. The story of Çuna&#7717;çepas has
already been made known by Professor Rodolph Roth,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
and by Professor Max Müller,<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> who translated it from the
<i>Âitareya-brâhma&#7751;am</i>; and I refer the reader to these
translations, as well as to the English version which Professor
Martin Haugh has given us of all the <i>Âitareya</i>. I
shall, therefore, here give but a short account of it, with
a few observations apropos to the subject in hand.</p>

<p>The king Hariç&#263;andras has no sons; the god Varu&#7751;as
the coverer, the gloomy, the watery, the king of the
waters,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> obliges him to promise that he will sacrifice
to him whatever is born to him. The king promises; a
child is born, who is named the red (Rohitas). Varu&#7751;as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>claims him; the father begs him to wait till the child has
cut his teeth, then till his first teeth are cast, then till he
is able to bear armour. It is evident that the father wishes
to wait till his son be strong enough to defend himself
against his persecutor, Varu&#7751;as. Varu&#7751;as thereupon
claims him in a more resolute manner, and Hariç&#263;andras
informs the son himself that he must be given up
in sacrifice. Rohitas takes his bow and flees into the
woods, where he lives by the chase. This first part of
the legend corresponds with those numerous European
popular tales, in which, now the devil, now the aquatic
monster, now the serpent, demands from a father the son
who has just been born to him without his knowledge.
The second part of the story of Çuna&#7717;çepas shows us the
hero in the forest; he has taken his bow with him, and
hence, like Râmas in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, who has scarcely
entered the forest than he begins to hunt, Rohitas turns
hunter, and hunts for the six years during which he
remains in the forest. But his chase is unsuccessful; he
wanders about in quest of some one to take his place as
the victim of Varu&#7751;as; at last he finds the brâhma&#7751;as
A&#289;igartas, who consents to give his own second son,
Çuna&#7717;çepas, for a hundred cows. The first-born being
particularly dear to the father, and the third being especially
beloved by the mother, cannot be sacrificed; the
second son, therefore, is ceded to Varu&#7751;as, the gloomy
god of night, who, like Yamas, binds all creatures with
his cords. We have already observed how the middle
son is the son of the celestial cow Aditis, the hidden sun,
the sun during and covered by the darkness of night, or,
in other words, bound by the fetters of Varu&#7751;as&mdash;and
it is his own father who binds him with those fetters.
His sacrifice begins in the evening. During the night he
appeals to all the gods. At last Indras, flattered by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
praise heaped upon him, concedes to him a golden chariot,
upon which, with praises to the Açvinâu, and help from
the dawn, Çuna&#7717;çepas, unbound from the fetters of
Varu&#7751;as, is delivered. These fetters of Varu&#7751;as, which
imprison the victim, bound and sacrificed by his own
father, help us to understand the second part of the
European popular tale of the son sacrificed against his
will to the demon by his father; for Çuna&#7717;çepas, towards
the end of the European story, takes the form of a horse,
Varu&#7751;as that of a demon, and the fetters of Varu&#7751;as are
the bridle of the horse, which the imprudent father sells
to the demon, together with his son in the shape of a
horse;<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> the beautiful daughter of the demon (the white
one, who, as usual, comes out of the black monster)
delivers the young man transformed into a horse; as in
the Vedic story of Çuna&#7717;çepas, it is explicitly the dawn
who is the young girl that delivers.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Varu&#7751;as is called
in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> the god who has in his hand a rope
(<i>pâçahastas</i>); his dwelling is on Mount Astas, where the
sun goes down, and which it is impossible to touch, because
it burns, in an immense palace, the work of
Viçvakarman, which has a hundred rooms, lakes with
nymphs, and trees of gold.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Evidently, Varu&#7751;as is here,
not a different form, but a different name of the god
Yamas, the pâçin, or furnished with rope, the constrictor
<i>par excellence</i>; for we are to suppose the magic display
of golden splendour in the evening heavens not so
much the work of the sun itself, as produced by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>gloomy god who sits on the mountain, who invests and surprises
the solar hero, and drags him into his kingdom. As
to Hariç&#263;andras and A&#289;igartas, Rohitas and Çuna&#7717;çepas,
they appear, in my opinion, to be themselves different
names for not only the same celestial phenomenon, but
the same mythical personage. Hariç&#263;andras is celebrated
in the legends as a solar king; Rohitas, his son, the red
one, is his <i>alter ego</i>, as well as his successor Çuna&#7717;çepas.
Hariç&#263;andras, moreover, who promises to sacrifice his son
to Varu&#7751;as, seems to differ little, if at all, from A&#289;igartas,
who sells his own son for the sacrifice. The <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
has given us a third name for the same unnatural father,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
in Viçvâmitras, who asks his own sons to sacrifice themselves,
instead of Çuna&#7717;çepas, who is under his protection,
and as they refuse to obey, he curses them.</p>

<p>The variation of the same legend which we find in the
<i>Harivanças</i><a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> proves these identities, and adds a new and
notable particular. The wife of Viçvâmitras designs, on
account of her poverty, to barter her middle son for a
hundred cows, and with that view already keeps him
tied with a rope like a slave. The grandfather of Rohitas,
Hariç&#263;andras's father, Triçañkus, wanders through the
woods, and delivers this son of Viçvâmitras, whose family
he thenceforth protects and maintains. The deeds of
Triçañkus, who begs of Vasish&#7789;as to be allowed to ascend
to heaven bodily, and who, by grace of Viçvâmitras,
obtains instead the favour of remaining suspended in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>air like a constellation, are also attributed to his son
Hariç&#263;andras; whence we may affirm, without much risk
of contradiction, that as Triçañkus is another name for
his son Hariç&#263;andras, so Hariç&#263;andras is another name for
his son Rohitas, and that, therefore, the Triçañkus of the
<i>Hariva&#7749;ças</i> is the same as the Rohitas of the <i>Âitareya</i>,
with this difference, that Triçañkus buys the son destined
to the sacrifice in order to free him, while Rohitas buys
him to free himself. But the first hundred cows given
by Triçañkus to Viçvâmitras do not suffice for him, and
the fruits of his hunting in the forest are not enough to
maintain the family, a circumstance which weighs upon
him almost as much as if the family were his own; upon
which, in order to save Viçvâmitras, in order to save
Viçvâmitras's son, and, we can perhaps add, to save himself,
he resolves to sacrifice, to kill the beautiful and
dearly-prized wife of Vasish&#7789;as (the very luminous). I
have said the wife of Vasish&#7789;as, but the <i>Hariva&#7749;ças</i>
says, speaking strictly, it was the cow of Vasish&#7789;as who
was killed. But we know from the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i><a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> that
this cow of Vasish&#7789;as, this kâmadhuk or kâmadhenus,
which yields at pleasure all that is wished for, this cow
of abundance, is kept by Vasish&#7789;as, under the name of
Çabâlâ, as his own wife. Viçvâmitras is covetous of her;
he demands her from Vasish&#7789;as, and offers a hundred
cows for her, the exact price which, in the <i>Hariva&#7749;ças</i>,
he receives from Triçañkus for his own son. Vasish&#7789;as
answers that he will not give her for a hundred, nor for
a thousand, nor even for a hundred thousand cows, for
Çabâlâ is his gem, his riches, his all, his life.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Viçvâmitras
carries her off; she returns to the feet of Vasish&#7789;as,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>and bellows; her bellowing calls forth armies, who come
out of her own body; the hundred sons of Viçvâmitras are
burned to ashes by them. These armies which come out
of the body of Vasish&#7789;as's cow remind us again of the
Vedic cow, from which come forth winged darts, or birds,
by which the enemies are filled with terror. Vasish&#7789;as is
a form of Indras; his cow is here the rain-cloud. Viçvâmitras,
who wishes to ravish the cow from Vasish&#7789;as,
often assumes monstrous forms in the Hindoo legends,
and is almost always malignant, perverse, and revengeful.
His hundred sons burned to cinders by Vasish&#7789;as remind
us, from one point of view, of the hundred cities of Çambaras
destroyed by Indras, and the hundred perverse
Dh&#7771;itarâshtrides of the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>; whence his
name, Viçvâmitras, which may also mean the enemy
of all (<i>viçva-amitras</i>), would agree well with his almost
demoniacal character.</p>

<p>This story of the cow of Vasish&#7789;as, whose relationship
with the legend of Çuna&#7717;çepas cannot be doubted, brings
us back to the animal forms of heroes and heroines from
which we started. In the story of Vasish&#7789;as, the cow-cloud,
the cow çabâlâ, or the spotted-cow, plays in the
epic poem the part of the cow Aditis, the cow p&#7771;içnis
(spotted, variegated), with which we are already familiar
in the Vedic hymns. This cow is benignant towards the
god, or the hero, or the wise Vasish&#7789;as, as the p&#7771;içnis is to
the god Indras. But we have seen in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>
itself the cloud as the enemy of the god, and represented
as a female form of the monster, as his sister. This
sister generally tries to seduce the god, promising to
deliver into his hands the monster her brother, and she
sometimes succeeds, as the witch Hidimbâ of the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,
who gives up her brother, the monster
Hidimbas, into the hands of the hero Bhîmas, who thereupon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
espouses her. On the other hand, Çûrpa&#7751;akhâ, the
sister of the monster Râva&#7751;as, does not succeed in her
intent; making herself beautiful, she endeavours to win
the affection of the hero Râmas; but being ridiculed by
him and by Lakshma&#7751;as, she becomes deformed, and
sends forth cries like a cloud in the rainy season,<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> exciting
her brothers to annihilate Râmas.</p>

<p>The same cloud-monster is found again in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,
under the name of Dundubhis, in the form of a
terrible buffalo with sharpened horns.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> The buffalo, as a
wild animal, is often chosen to represent the principle of
evil, in the same way as the bull, increaser of the bovine
herds, is selected as the image of good. This bellowing
buffalo, whence his name of Dundubhis (drum), strikes
and knocks with his two horns at the door of the cavern<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
of the son of Indras (Bâlin), the king of the monkeys.
But Bâlin takes Dundubhis by the horns, throws him on
the ground, and destroys him.</p>

<p>Dundus is also a name given to the father of K&#7771;ish&#7751;as,
or the black one, who in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> is still a demon,
and only later becomes the god of cows and cowherds, a
govindas, or pastor <i>par excellence</i>.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Indras, his enemy in
the Vedas, having fallen from heaven, he became one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>the most popular gods, and even sometimes the most
popular form of the deity. In the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, for
instance, he is almost the <i>deus ex machina</i> of the battles
between the Pâ&#7751;&#7693;avas and the Dhârtarâsh&#7789;râs, and presents
many analogies to the Zeus of the Iliad; whereas
Indras plays only a part in the episodes, the rain-giver and
thunderer being often forgotten for the black one who prepares
and hurls the light. But the fall of Indras begins in
the Vedâs themselves. In the <i>Ya&#501;urvedas</i>, Viçvarûpas, the
son of Tvash&#7789;ar, whom Indras kills, appears as no less than
the purohitas or high-priest of the gods, and son of a
daughter of the Asurâs; he has three heads, of which one
drinks the ambrosia, another the spirituous drink, while
the third eats food. Indras cuts off Viçvarûpas's three
heads, in revenge of the one which drinks his ambrosia;
he is therefore charged with having killed a Brâhman,
and decried as a brâhmanicide.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> In the <i>Âitareya-brâhma&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
the criminality of Indras in this regard is
confirmed, to which the <i>Kâushîtaki-Upanishad</i> also
refers. In the seventh book of the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, even
the multiform monster Râva&#7751;as is represented as a great
penitent, whom Brâhman fills with supreme grace; in
the sixth book, the son of the wind, Hanumant, cuts off
the three heads of the Râvanide monster Triçiras (having
three heads), as one day Indras cut off the three heads
of the monster V&#7771;itras, son of Tvash&#7789;ar;<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and he cuts all
the three heads off together (<i>samas</i>), as the hero of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>European popular tales must cut off, at a blow, the three
heads of the serpent, the wizard, otherwise he is powerless,
and able to do nothing. The monster, like the hero, seems
to have a special affinity for the number three: hence
the three heads of Triçiras, as also the three brothers of
Lañkâ&mdash;Râva&#7751;as, the eldest brother, who reigns; Kumbhakar&#7751;as,
the middle brother, who sleeps; Vibhisha&#7751;as, the
third brother, whom the two others do not care about, but
who alone is just and good, and who alone obtains the gift
of immortality.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> We have evidently here again the three
Vedic brothers; the two eldest in demoniacal form, the
youngest a friend of the divine hero, and who, by the victory
of Râmas over the monster Râva&#7751;as, obtains the kingdom
of Lañkâ. As to the brothers Râmas and Lakshma&#7751;as,
and the brothers Bâlin and Sugrîvas, their natural place is
in the story of the two twins, which will be referred to in
the next chapter, although Hanumant, the son of the wind,
figures second to them in the character of strong brother.</p>

<p>The three interesting heroic brothers come out more
prominently in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, where of the five
Pâ&#7751;davas brothers, three stay on one side, and are
Yudhish&#7789;hiras, son of the god Yamas, the wise brother;
Bhîmas (the terrible), or V&#7771;ikodâras (wolf's belly), son of
Vâyus (the wind), the strong brother (another form of
Hanumant, in company with whom he is also found in
the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, on Mount Gandhamâdanas); and
Argunas (the splendid), the son of Indras, the genial,
dexterous, fortunate, victorious brother, he who wins the
bride. The first brother gives the best advice; the
second shows proof of greatest strength; the third
brother wins, conquers the bride. They are precisely
the three Vedic brothers &#7770;ibhavas, Ekatas, Dvîtas, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Tritas, in the same relationships to one another and with
the same natures; only the legend is amplified.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> As to
their other brothers, twins, born of another mother,
Nakulas and Sahadevas, they are the sons of the two
Açvinâu, and feebly repeat in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i> the
exploits of the two celestial twins. Bhîmas or V&#7771;ikodâras,
the second brother, is considered the strongest, (balavatâ&#7745;
çreshtha&#7717;), because immediately after birth, <i>i.e.</i>, scarcely
has he come forth out of his mother (like the Vedic
Marutas), than he breaks the rock upon which he falls,
because he breaks his fetters as soon as he is bound
with them (like Hanumant when he becomes the prisoner
of Râva&#7751;as), because he carries his brothers during the
night (as Hanumant carries Râmas), as he flees from the
burning house prepared by the impious Duryodhanas
(<i>i.e.</i>, from the burning sky of evening), and because in
the kingdom of serpents, where Duryodhanas threw him
down (that is, the night), he drinks the water of strength.
A serpent, wishing to benefit Bhîmas, says to Vasukis,
king of the serpents&mdash;"Let there be given to him as
much strength as he can drink from that cistern in which
is placed the strength of a thousand serpents."<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Bhîmas,
at one draught, drinks the whole cisternful; and with
similar expedition, he drains consecutively eight cisterns.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
The first-born of the Pân&#7693;avas is dear to his
father Yamas, the god of justice, Dharmarâ&#501;as,&mdash;and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>himself indeed called Dharmarâ&#501;as; and when he prepares
himself to ascend into heaven, the god Yamas
follows him in the form of a dog: by his skill in solving
enigmas, he saves his brother Bhîmas from the king of
the serpents. The third brother, Ar&#501;unas, son of Indras,
is the Benjamin of the Vedic supreme God. Indras welcomes
him with festivals in heaven, whither Ar&#501;unas had
gone to find him. Ar&#501;unas is an infallible archer, like
Indras; like Indras, he several times regains the cows
from the robbers or from the enemies; and, like Indras,
he wins and conquers his bride; he is born by the assistance
of all the celestials; he is invincible (<i>a&#289;ayas</i>); he is
the best son (<i>vara&#7717; putras</i>);<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> he alone of the three
brothers has compassion on his master Dro&#7751;as and delivers
him from an aquatic monster.<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p>But there is yet another particular which shows the
resemblance between the three brothers Pâ&#7751;&#7693;avas and the
three brothers of the Vedas; it is their dwelling, hidden
in the palace of the king Virâ&#7789;a, in the fourth book of the
<i>Mahâbhâratam</i>. They are exiled from the kingdom, like
Râmas; they flee from the persecution of their enemies,
now into the woods, now, as the &#7770;ibhavas, disguised as
workmen in the palace of Virâ&#7789;as, to whom their presence
brings every kind of happiness.</p>

<p>We meet with these three brothers again, episodically,
in the three disciples of Dhâumyas, in the first book of the
<i>Mahâbhâratam</i>.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The first disciple, Upamanyus, takes
his master's cows out to pasture, and, out of sensitive regard
for his master's interest, refuses to drink not only
their milk, but even the foam from their mouths, and fasts
till, like to perish of hunger, he bites a leaf of arkapatrâ
(properly, leaf of the sun, the <i>aristolochia indica</i>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>when he instantly becomes blind. He wanders about and
falls into a well; he there sings a hymn to the Açvinâu,
and they come immediately to deliver him. The second
brother, Uddâlakas, places his body, as a dike, to arrest
the course of the waters. The third brother is Vedas, he
who sees, he who knows, whose disciple Utañkas is himself
in the form of a hero. Utañkas, like the Vedic
Tritas, and the Pâ&#7751;&#7693;avas Ar&#501;u&#7751;as, is protected by
Indras. He is sent by the wife of his master to abstract
the earrings of the wife of King Pâushyas. He sets out;
on his way he meets a gigantic bull, and a horseman,
who bids him, if he would succeed, eat the excrement of
the bull; he does so, rinsing his mouth afterwards. He
then presents himself to King Pâushyas and informs him
of his message; the king consigns the earrings to him,
but cautions him to beware of Takshakas, the king of the
serpents. Utañkas says that he is not afraid of him, and
sets out with the earrings; but as he puts down the earrings
upon the shore, in order to bathe, Takshakas presents
himself in the shape of a naked mendicant, whips
them up, and flees away with them. Utañkas follows
him, but Takshakas resumes his serpent form, penetrates
the ground, and descends under it; Utañkas
attempts to follow the serpent, but does not succeed in
cleaving the entrance, which corresponds to the Vedic rock
under which the monster keeps his prey. Indras sees
him tiring himself in vain, and sends his weapon, in order
that it may be for a help to Utañkas; that weapon, or
club, penetrating, opened the cavern.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> This club, this
weapon of Indras is evidently the thunderbolt.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Utañkas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>descends into the kingdom of the serpents, full of infinite
wonders. Indras reappears at his side in the shape of a
horse,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> and obliges the king, Takshakas, to give back the
earrings; having taken which, Utañkas mounts the
horse, that he may be carried more swiftly to the wife of
his master, from whom he learns that the horseman seen
by him on the way was none other than Indras himself;
his horse, Agnis, the god of fire; the bull, the steed of
Indras, or the elephant Âiravatas; the excrement of the
bull, the ambrosia, which made him immortal in the
kingdom of the serpents. In another episode of the
same (the first) book of the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> we again
find Indras busied in the search of the earrings, that is
to say, of the excessively fleshy part hanging from the
ears of Kar&#7751;as, the child of the sun, who, as soon as
born, had been abandoned upon the waters. We have
seen above how the two Açvinâu are also represented in
the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> as the two ears of Vish&#7751;us Râmas (as
the sun and moon are said to be his eyes); hence it
seems to me that these mythical earrings, coveted by
Indras, and protected by him, are nothing else than the
two Açvinâu, the two luminous twilights (in connection
with the sun and the moon), in which Indras, and, still
more than he, the aurora, his wife, take such delight.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>In the commentary of <i>Buddhagoshas</i> on the Buddhist
Dhammapadam, we have the three brothers again; the two
eldest are represented as fleeing from the persecution of
their cruel step-mother; the third brother, Suriyas (Sûryas,
the sun), goes to overtake them. The eldest counsels or
commands, the second lends his aid, and the youngest
fights. The second and third brothers fall into a fountain,
under the power of a monster; the first-born saves them by
his knowledge, as, in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, Yudhish&#7789;hiras,
by his skill in solving riddles, delivers the second brother
from the fetters of the forest of the monster serpent.</p>

<p>This mode of delivering the hero, by propounding a
question or a riddle, is very common in the Hindoo
legends. Even in the <i>Pa&#324;&#263;atantram</i>,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> a Brâhman who
falls under the power of a forest monster who leaps on
his shoulders, frees himself by asking why his feet are so
soft. The monster confesses that it is because, on account
of a vow, he cannot touch the earth with his feet. The
Brâhman then betakes himself to a sacred pond; the
monster wishes to take a bath, and the Brâhman throws
him in; the monster orders him to stay there till he has
bathed and said his orisons. The Brâhman profits by
this opportunity to make his escape, knowing that the
monster will not be able to overtake him, as he cannot
put his feet to the ground. It is the usual vulnerability,
weakness, or imperfection of the hero, or the monster, in
the feet, and, if an animal is spoken of, in the tail.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>The <i>Mahâbhâratam</i> has shown us the three Vedic
brothers, of whom the youngest has fallen into the well;
it also presents to us, in the witch (<i>asurî</i>) Çarmish&#7789;hâ,
daughter of V&#7771;ishaparvan, king of the demons, and in
the nymph Devayânî, daughter of Çukras, who credits
herself with the virtue of Indras as the rain-giver,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> the
two rival sisters of the Vedas, the good and the evil. In
the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> the witch Çûrpanakhâ, who seduces
Râmas, in order to take the place of Sîtâ at his side, is
compared to Çarmish&#7789;hâ, who seduced Nâhushas. In the
<i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, Çarmish&#7789;hâ assumes the guise of Devayânî,
whom she throws into a well. Yayâtis, son of
King Nâhushas, goes to the chase; feeling thirsty, he
stops near the well; from the bottom of the well a young
girl looks up, like a flame of fire.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The prince takes her
by the right hand and draws her up; and because in the
marriage ceremony, the bride is taken by the right hand,<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
the prince Yayâtis is said to marry Devayânî. But even
after she is a wife, Çarmish&#7789;hâ continues to seduce her
husband, to whom she unites herself. Two sons are born
of Devayânî, Yadus and Turvasas, similar to Indras and
Vish&#7751;us (a new form of the twins, of the Açvinâu); three
are born of Çarmish&#7789;hâ, Duhyus, Anus, and Pûrus; and
here also the third brother is the most glorious and
valiant. And in this way the episode is connected with
the essential legend of the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, and one and
the same general myth is multiplied into an infinity of
particular legends. As the genealogy of the gods and
heroes is infinite, so is there an infinite number of
forms assumed by the same myth and of the names
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>assumed by the same hero. Each day gave birth in the
heavens to a new hero and a new monster, who exterminate
each other, and afterwards revive in an aspect
more or less glorious, according as their names were more
or less fortunate.</p>

<p>It is for the same reason that the sons always recognise
their fathers without having once seen them or even
heard them spoken of; they recognise themselves in
their fathers. Thus Çakuntalâ and Urvacî enable their
mother to find again the husband that she has lost, and
their father to recover his lost wife. Thus in the episode
of Devayânî and Çarmish&#7789;hâ, when the former wishes to
know who is the father of the three sons of Çarmish&#7789;hâ,
so similar to the sons of immortals, she turns to them,
and they tell her at once.</p>

<p>For this fault, Yayâtis, from being young, is fated to
become old. He then beseeches the two eldest of the
three sons that he had by Çarmish&#7789;hâ to take on themselves
the old age of their father; they refuse, but the
third son, Pûrus, out of reverence for his father, consents
to become old in his stead, to give up his youth to his
father. After a thousand years, the king Yayâtis, satiated
with life, restores to his son Pûrus his youth, and although
he is the youngest, along with his youth, the kingdom,
because he found him the only one of the three who
respected the paternal will; and he expels the two eldest
brothers.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes, however, the blind old father is entirely
abandoned by his sons. Thus the old Dîrghatamas (of the
vast darkness), blind from birth, is deprived of food, and
thrown into the water by his wife and sons,<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> but a heroic
king saves him, in order, by his wife, to beget sons for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>him. We have in Dîrghatamas and Yayâtis, King Lear
in embryo.</p>

<p>In the same legend of Dîrghatamas, we find an
exchange of wives. Queen Sudeshnâ, instead of going
herself, sends her servant-maid, her foster-sister, to be
embraced by Dîrghatamas.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> In the cunning Sudeshnâ
we have an ancient variation of Queen Berta.</p>

<p>Other blind men occur frequently in the Hindoo
legends. I shall here cite only Andhakas (the blind one)
and V&#7771;ish&#7751;is (the sheep, as the lame one),<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> who appear
in the <i>Harivanças</i><a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> as the two sons of Mâdrî. But we
know from the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, that the two sons of
Mâdrî are a human incarnation of the celestial twins, the
Açvinâu; and here we come again upon the blind-lame
one of the Vedas, the solar hero in his twin forms, the
two Açvinâu protected by Indras, and companions of the
dawn.</p>

<p>The <i>Pa&#324;&#263;atantram</i><a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> represents the blind and the
crooked, or hunchbacked,<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> in union with the three-breasted
princess (<i>i.e.</i>, the triple sister, the aurora in the evening,
the aurora in the night, the aurora in the morning; the
breast of the night nourishing the defective, the monstrous,
which the morning sweeps away). The crooked guides
the blind with a stick; they both marry the three-breasted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>princess. The blind recovers sight by the steam of the
poison of a black serpent, cooked in milk (the darkness
of night, or of winter, mixed with the clearness of day,
or of the snow); he then, being a strongly-built man,
takes the hunchback by the legs, and beats his hunch
against the third and superfluous breast of the princess.
The anterior prominence of the latter, and the posterior
one of the former, enter into their respective bodies;<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
thus the blind, the crooked, and the three-breasted
princess help and cure each other; the two Açvinâu and
the aurora (or the spring) reappear together in beauty.
The Açvinâu and the aurora also come forth together
from the monstrous shades of night; the Açvinâu contend
for the aurora; as we shall see soon, and in the next
chapter, the delivered bride disputed for by the brothers.</p>

<p>The sun and the aurora flee from each other; this
spectacle has been represented in different ways by the
popular imagination; and one of the most familiar is certainly
that of a beautiful young girl who, running more
quickly than the prince, escapes from him. This incident,
which is already described in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, occurs
again in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> in the legend of the loves
of the virgin Tapatî, daughter of the sun (the luminous
and burning aurora, and also the summer season, ardent
as Dahanâ), with the king Sa&#7745;vara&#7751;as, son of the bear
(<i>&#7771;ikshaputras</i>, a kind of Indras). The king Sa&#7745;vara&#7751;as
arrives on horseback with his retinue at the mountain, in
order to hunt; he ties his horse up and begins the chase,
when he sees on the mountain the beautiful girl, the
daughter of the sun, who, covered with ornaments, shines
like the sun; he declares his love and wishes to make her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>his own; she answers not a word, but flees and disappears
like the lightning in the clouds;<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> the king cannot overtake
her, because his horse, while he was hunting, has
died of hunger and thirst; he searches in vain through
the forest, but not seeing her, he throws himself almost
breathless to the ground. As he lies there the beautiful
girl appears again, approaches and wakens him; he again
speaks to her of love, and she answers that he must ask her
father the sun, and then, still quite innocent, she disappears
swiftly on high (<i>ûrdhvam</i>). The king again faints; his
minister sprinkles him with the water of health, and makes
him revive, but he refuses to leave the mountain, and
having dismissed his hunting company, he awaits the
arrival of the great purohitas Vasish&#7789;has, by whose mediation
he demands from the sun his daughter Tapatî to
wife; the sun consents, and Vasish&#7789;has reconducts to
Sa&#7745;vara&#7751;as, for the third time, the beautiful girl as his
legitimate wife. The husband and wife live together happily
on the mountain of their loves; but as long as King
Sa&#7745;vara&#7751;as remains with Tapatî upon this mountain, no
rain falls upon the earth; wherefore the king, out of love
for his subjects, returns to his palace, upon which Indras
pours down the rain, and begins again to fructify the earth.<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p>We said a little ago that Vasish&#7789;has himself caused it
to rain (<i>abhyavarshata</i>); and the mention of Vasish&#7789;has
reminds us of the particularly rain-giving, cloudy, and
lunar function of his cow Kâdmadhenus, whose wonderful
productions are again described in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>.<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
Besides milk and ambrosia, she yields herbs and gems,
which we have already referred to, as analogous products
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>in mythology. The cow of Vasish&#7789;has is, besides her
tail, celebrated for her breasts, her horns, and even her
ears ending in a point; whence her name of <i>çañkukar&#7751;â</i>
(the masculine form of which is generally applied to the
ass). And in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, also, the wise Viçvâmitras
is covetous of this wonderful cow; the cow bellows and
drops fire from her tail, and radiates from every part of
her body armies which disperse those of the son of Gadhis.
Viçvâmitras then avenges himself in other ways
upon the sons of Vasish&#7789;has; having, <i>e.g.</i>, become a
cannibal, he eats them.</p>

<p>Vasish&#7789;has cannot endure the pain this causes him:
he tries to throw himself down from the summit of Mount
Merus, but he falls without hurting himself; he throws
himself into the fire, but does not burn himself; and,
finally, he leaps into the sea, but is not drowned. These
three miracles are accomplished every day by the solar
hero, who throws himself down from the mountain into
the gloomy ocean of night, after having passed through
the burning sky of evening.</p>

<p>Vasish&#7789;has ends by freeing, with the help of charmed
water, the monster Viçvâmitras from his curse; and the
latter is no sooner delivered from the demon who possessed
him, than he begins again to illumine the forest with his
splendour, as the sun illumines a twilight cloud. The friendships,
enmities, and rivalries of Vasish&#7789;has and Viçvâmitras
seem to be another version of those of the two Açvinâu,
whom we shall particularly describe in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is high time, as the reader will think, to
conclude this part of our study, which treats of the
mythical cow of India. We might easily, indeed, have
made it much larger, had our design been to chain
together, link by link, all the traditions and legends in
which the cow plays a primary or subordinate part. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
it is better to stop short, lest, by expatiating further, we
should lose sight of the essential aim of our work, and be
tempted into digressions from the legends relating to
beasts to those relating to men; besides, we think that
we have sufficiently proved the thesis of this chapter,
and shown how the principal mythical subjects of the
Vedic hymns are not only preserved, but developed, in the
posterior Hindoo traditions. It is not entirely our fault
if, from cows, we pass so often to princesses, and from
bulls to princes; the myth itself involves and indicates
these transformations. Hence we find the bull Indras,
the winner of the cows, become a winner and a seducer of
women; we see the bull Wind, who aids Indras in the
conquest of the cows, become the violator of a hundred
damsels;<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> we read of the bull and god Rudras, as
husband of Umâ, given up to sensual indulgence for a
hundred years without a pause; that the son of the bull,
or of the wind, Hanumant, does prodigies of valour and
strength for the sake of a beautiful woman, and receives,
as a reward for his zeal, from the king Bharatas, a
hundred thousand cows, sixteen wives, and a hundred
servant-maids.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> What could Hanumant have done with
so many wives and maids, if he were simply a bull? or
what could he have done with so many cows, if he had
been an ape? It is these inconsistencies which have
caused mythology to be condemned by the crowd of old
but prolific pedants, as a vain science; whereas, on the
contrary, it is precisely these inconsistencies which
raise it, in our esteem, to the rank of a valid science.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>He who handed down to us the feats of Hanumant, took
care also to tell us how he had the faculty of changing
his form at will; and this faculty, attributed to this impersonation
of a celestial phenomenon, is the fruit of one
of the most <i>naïve</i> but just observations of virgin and
grandiose nature.</p>

<p>Moving now from India westwards, we find on one side
the Iranian, and on the other the Turanian traditions. We
cannot pass into Europe without at least indicating the
general character of each.</p>

<p>In the Persian cosmogony, the bull (<i>gâus aevo dâto</i>) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
one of the first of created existences, being as old as the
elements. It is, moreover, well known how much importance
was ascribed to the bull among the Persians in
the mysteries of the solar god Mithra, who is represented
as a beautiful youth, holding the horns of a bull in his
left hand, and having the knife of sacrifice in his right.
Mithra sacrificing the bull is just the solar hero sacrificing
himself in the evening. Indeed, in the Persian tradition,
Mithra, like the Hindoo Yamas, holds the office of god of
the dead, and as such, like Yamas, is of a monstrous
aspect, and is found in the <i>Yaçna</i> represented with a
thousand ears and ten thousand eyes.</p>

<p>As in India, so in Persia, the urine of the cow is used
in ceremonies of purification, during which it is drunk.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
We have already seen in the story of Utañkas how the
excrement of the bull, upon which Utañkas fed, was
ambrosia itself; and, indeed, all is beneficial which is
given by the cow of abundance (the moon, the cloud, and
the aurora), and by the divine bull (the moon and the
sun). The mythical belief was natural, however disgusting
when we insist on literal interpretation.</p>

<p>And even in the Persian tradition itself, a distinction
already exists between common bulls or oxen and sacred
or privileged ones. This distinction appears in the legend
of Gemshid, whose bulls were all devoured by the devil,
as long as they were protected by no magical rites; whilst,
when he was given a red ox (or bull) cooked in old, that
is strong, vinegar, to which was added garlic and rue
(famous for its potency in exorcism), he disappeared
and was never seen again.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> The rue is probably the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>fabulous plant which the Zend tradition surmises to have
sprung from the sea <i>Vôuru-Kasha</i>, whence Ahura Mazda
draws the clouds, from which all healthful water is
derived, and which corresponds to the sea of milk of
Hindoo tradition, in which the ambrosia is agitated.</p>

<p>Thus the funereal cypress of Kishmar (planted by Zarathustra,
with a branch from the tree of Paradise), under
which more than two thousand cows and sheep could
pasture, and the innumerable birds of which darkened
the air, obscuring the light of the sun, reminds us of the
celestial forest of the Vedâs, in which the shepherd-hero
and the hunter-hero wander and are lost.</p>

<p>The idea of the funereal tree recalls to us that of the
Persian mountain Arezûra or Demâvend, where the demons
met together to plot evil, and where was the gate of hell.<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

<p>The Zend word <i>açma</i>, which signifies stone and heaven,
yields us, in its double meaning, the key to the interpretation
of the myth. This stone, inasmuch as it is dark, is
of evil omen; inasmuch as it shines, it is a gem, or gives
the gem (the moon or the sun); whence, according to the
<i>Minokhired</i>, the sky is the progeny of a precious stone.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p>Thus to the mountain of the demons (where the sun
goes down), is opposed in Persian tradition the glorious
mountain, out of which are born the heroes and the kings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>(or from which the sun rises and the moon); because
Haoma is born there (the Hindoo Somas), the ambrosial,
golden, and health-bringing god, who gives them the
divine nourishment, and because the sacred bird, which
stays on that mountain, feeds them with ambrosia,
whence the <i>Yaçna</i><a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> invites Haoma to grow on the road
of the birds.</p>

<p>In a rather obscure passage of the <i>Gâthâ Ahunavaiti</i>,
confirmed by the <i>Bundehesh</i>, the soul of the bull (or of
the cow, as the case may be), despoiled of his body by
the evil one, complains to the Supreme Creator that he is
without defence against the assaults of his enemies, and
that he has no invincible protector. Ahura Mazda seems
to wish only to give him spiritual help, but the bull continues
to declare himself unsatisfied, until Zarathustra, the
defender, accords it, and he receives the gift of efficacious
favours which Ahura Mazda alone possesses.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Zarathustra
is himself also born upon a mountain;<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> while his son
Çaoshya&#324;ç, the deliverer, comes out of the waters.</p>

<p>A sacred cow, or at least a bitch which guards the
cows (<i>paçuvaiti</i>), seems, besides a good fairy, to be, in
the <i>Vendiad</i> itself,<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> the conductor of the souls across the
bridge &#262;invat, created by Ahura Mazda, to the kingdom
of the blessed. The cow, as the guide of the souls<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> lost
in the kingdom of the dead, and placed upon the bridge,
is probably the moon; the bitch (also the moon) reminds
us of the Hindoo Saramâ, the bitch which aids the heroes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>who have lost themselves in the nocturnal forest, grotto,
or darkness. In the same chapter, after accounts of the
bridge, we read the praise of the good Çaoka, who has
many eyes (like the brâhmanic Indras, disguised as a
woman, having a thousand eyes, and, after the adventure
of Ahalyâ, a thousand wombs&mdash;the god hidden in
the night, who looks at the world through a thousand
stars); after Çaoka, of the splendid Veretraghna (who corresponds
to V&#7771;itrahan, properly the discomfiter of the all-covering
darkness); and after him, of the luminous star
Tistar, which seems a bull with golden hoofs,<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> which
again must refer to the moon; as the Gâhs, who, according
to Anquetil, "sont occupées à filer des robes pour les
justes dans le ciel," like the cows and Madonnas in our
popular tales, cannot be very different from the fairy, or at
least from the stars which form her crown. The <i>Khorda
Avesta</i>, in its hymns in praise of Mithra, celebrates the
perfect friendship which reigns between the sun and the
moon, and sings of the moon immediately after singing
of the sun Mithra, and the splendid Tistar immediately
after the moon, whose light is said to come from the
constellation Tistrya.</p>

<p>We can thus divine the meaning of Geusurva (the soul
of the bull or the cow), of which, besides the soul, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
body also is invoked in the <i>Yaçna</i>.<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> The Geusurva
appears in the <i>Yaçna</i> itself<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> as the protectress of the
fourteenth day of the month, or of the full-moon, viewed
as a full cow. And when it is said in the <i>Khorda
Avesta</i><a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> that one must not sacrifice to the Geusurva at the
time when the Daevas, or demons, are practising their evil-doings,
it seems to me to indicate clearly enough that the
sacrifice was to take place while the moon was increasing,
and not while it was diminishing. Thus Asha Vahista,
who reminds us of the Hindoo Vasish&#7789;has and his marvellous
cow, has the power of conjuring away illness,
north winds&mdash;in a word, evil of every kind&mdash;only when
Ag&#771;ro-mai&#7751;yus appears without help.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>We have seen in the legend of Uta&#241;kas how, as the
youth is on his way to take the queen's earrings, he
meets a bull, upon the excrement of which he feeds, as
upon ambrosia; that this ambrosial bull stays near Indras,
as Indras and Somas are invoked together; and we
noticed that from this mythical belief was derived the
superstitious Hindoo custom of purifying one's self by
means of the excrement of a cow. The same custom
passed into Persia; and the <i>Khorda Avesta</i><a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> has preserved
the formula to be recited by the devotee, whilst he
holds in his hands the urine of an ox or cow, preparatory
to washing his face with it:&mdash;"Destroyed, destroyed be
the demon Ahriman, whose actions and works are cursed.
His actions and works do not come to us. May the
thirty-three Amshaspands (the immortal saints, who correspond
to the thirty-three Vedic devâs), and Ormazd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>be victorious and pure!" It is said this remedial formula
was used for the first time by Yima, when, from having
touched Ahriman, in order to extricate from his body, by
fraud, Takh mo Urupa, whom the demon had devoured,
he had an eruption on his hand. Finally, it is interesting
to learn that one of the Zend names of the moon is
<i>gao&#263;ithra</i>, which means he that contains the seed of the
bull, since, according to the <i>Bundehesh</i>, the seed of the
primitive bull passed into the moon, who, having purified
it, used it to procreate other cattle (<i>pôuru çaredho</i>).</p>

<p>As to the aurora, there seems to be no doubt but that
she was represented in ancient Persia by Ardvî Çûra
Anâhita, the elevated, the strong, the innocent or pure,
according to the interpretation of Professor Spiegel; she
also drives a chariot drawn by four white horses, which
she guides herself; she has a veil, a diadem, and bracelets
of gold, beautiful earrings (the Vedic Açvinâu), a
dress of beavers' skin, and prominent breasts; she is
beautiful, and she is a good young girl who protects men
and women. She is often invoked in the <i>Khorda Avesta</i>,
like the Vedic aurora, to exorcise the demons, and to help
the heroes who combat them; she herself has the strength
of a thousand men, and is a marvellous heroine, like the
Vedic amazon whom Indras fought with; her body is
girt round with a girdle. The probability of this comparison
seems to pass into certainty after reading a hymn
of the <i>Khorda Avesta</i>,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> even in the version of Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Spiegel, who perhaps would have introduced some little
variation if he had recognised the aurora in Ardvî Çûra
Anâhita. In this hymn, the victorious and mighty
Thraetaona, in the form of a bird, flies for three days and
three nights, which reminds us of the fugitive Indras of
the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, who wades across the rivers after his
victory; at the end of the third night he arrives near the
aurora, and beseeches Ardvî Çûra Anâhita (that is, as it
seems to us, the aurora herself, elevated, mighty, and
innocent) to come and help him, that he may pass the
waters and touch the ground at her habitation. Then
Ardvî Çûra Anâhita appears in the shape of a beautiful,
strong, and splendid girl, having a golden diadem and
wearing shoes of gold (cfr. the <i>Yast</i>, xxi. 19) on her feet
(this is perhaps another feeble foreshadow of Cinderella's
slippers); the beautiful girl takes him by one arm (the
bird has, it seems, become a hero), and gives him back
health and strength. But the certainty increases still
more when, as the Vedic aurora is the first of those who
arrive, winning the race in her chariot, the so-called
Ardhvî Çûra Anâhita appears in the <i>Khorda Avesta</i> as
"the first who guides the chariot;"<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> and we are recommended
to offer up sacrifices to her at break of day, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the sun rises.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> We have seen the Vedic aurora and
the sun propose and solve riddles; we have seen the
Hindoo solar hero free himself from the monster by proposing
or solving insoluble enigmas; in the same way,
in the <i>Avesta</i>, the hero Yaçto Fryanananm asks Ardvî
Çûra Anâhita to help him to solve ninety-nine enigmas,
in order that he may free himself from the monster
Akhtya.</p>

<p>Add to this that Ardvî Çûra Anâhita, like the Vedic
aurora, is a giver of cows and horses, and that these
animals are offered to her by her devotees. The aurora
herself, in the invocation made to her in the sixth prayer
of the <i>Khorda Avesta</i>, is also called "elevated," and furnished
with swift and splendid horses.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The fact of
finding the Anâhita drawn by four white horses, like
the sun Mithra, enhances the evidence of this identity.
And if the aurora is not explicitly represented in
the <i>Avesta</i> as a cow, we infer that it was so conceived
of, from the worship of Mithra, who was adored from the
first streak of daylight till midday. Mithra often receives
the epithet of "he who possesses vast pasture-lands;"
the morning sun is therefore a pastoral god; and if so, we
are constrained to think of the Persian aurora too as, if
not a cow, at least a female cowherd.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>But Mithra is not a god of mere idyllic exploits, he
is also a hero; the <i>Vendidad</i><a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> salutes him as "the most
victorious of the victors." The booty of his victory
[essentially due to his immediate predecessors Veretraghna
(V&#7771;itrahan) and Çraosha]<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> must have been
the cows of the aurora, without which his immense
pasture-lands would have been of no use to him. Indeed
it is said that Mithra enables owners of herds to
recover their lost oxen.<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>But Mithra is not the only prominent hero of the
<i>Avesta</i>. Besides him, the above-cited Veretraghna, with
all his secondary and tertiary reflections, plays an important
part in it. Now, this Veretraghna, who offers
numerous analogies to the Vedic Indras, killer of V&#7771;itras,
is, like Indras, now a hero, now a horse, now a bird, now
a sheep, now a wild boar, and now a bull.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> As the bull
Indras assists Tritas, Trâitanas, and Kavya U&#263;anas<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> in
the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, so the bull Veretraghna in the <i>Avesta</i>, partaking
of the nature of one Thrita<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> who is rich, splendid,
and strong, and who, like Indras, cures maladies by the
help of the guardian of the metals (the usual co-relation
between the hero and the magic pearl), assists Thraetaona,
the killer of the serpent Duhâka (Azhi Dahâka)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>and the hero Kava Uça, of which Kava Haoçrava is
another name rather than another form. The Thrita and
Thraetaona of the <i>Zend</i> are peculiarly interesting, because
they remind us, though vaguely, of the Vedic myth of
the three brothers. Only the <i>Avesta</i> names Thrita and
Thraetaona as two distinct divine heroes; it attributes
to Thraetaona the second place among the three brothers;
and as in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, it is the second brother,
the strong Bhîmas, who falls into the waters, whilst the
third brother, Ar&#501;unas, delivers others from the marine
monster by his valour, so in the <i>Avesta</i> it is Thraetaona
who comes out of the waters, or who is the son of Athvya
(-Âptya). But every one can see the point of contact,
connection, or identification between the two hero-brothers.
It is Bhîmas who comes out of the waters, and
Ar&#501;unas who extricates him, that is, who extricates his
own strength, expressed in Bhîmas (the subject, and his
virtue, become the object, being inclosed in one person).
They are confounded together, inasmuch as Thraetaona,
son of him who stays in the waters, or of the watery one,
or he who comes out of the waters, and kills the demon,
must be the same as Thrita, the third one, who has the
virtue of curing demoniacal diseases. Thraetaona, the
killer of the serpent, and Thrita, who destroys the evil-doing
ones, are found again, with a different splendour,
in the same heroic adventure. Scarcely an instant transpires
between the time when the hero was a victim and
that in which Veretraghna, or Thraetaona, or Thrita, the
hero, triumphs in his own liberation.</p>

<p>In the <i>Yaçna</i>,<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> we find three men who, by their piety,
win the favour of the god Haoma (Soma, the lunar god,
the moon, the good magician, the good fairy). The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
is Vivaghâo, the second Âthvya, and the third Thrita;
from which we are led to conclude that Vivaghâo is the
eldest brother, Âthvya the second, and Thrita the youngest.
On account of their piety, they obtain sons; the son of
Vivaghâo is Yima (the Vedic Yamas), the wise, the
happy, the heavenly; the son of Âthvya is Thraetaona,
the warrior who discomfits the monster; the third, Thrita,
called the most useful, has two sons, Urvâksha and
Kereçâçpa, who remind us of the Açvinâu. Âthvya's
son and Thrita being confounded in one person, Thraetaona,
or Thrita, forms a new triumvirate with Urvâksha
and Kereçâçpa, as the Vedic Indras with the two Açvinâu.
The story of the three brothers and that of the two brothers
seem to be interwoven even in the myth, as they certainly
are afterwards in the legend. To the three brothers,
moreover, correspond, in the <i>Avesta</i>, the three sisters, the
three daughters of Zarathustra and of Hvôvi: Freni,
Thriti, and Pouru&#263;içsta.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> The first seems to correspond to
Yamas, the second to Âptya and his son Thraetaona (or
Thrita), the third, the luminous, the beautiful (as being
the aurora), to the two handsome brother horsemen,
Urvâksha and Kereçâçpa (the Açvinâu).</p>

<p>The solar hero comes out of his difficulties, and triumphs
over his enemies, not only by force of arms, but by his innate
strength and prowess. This extraordinary strength,
by which he moves and is borne along, and which renders
him irresistible, is the wind, invoked by the heroes in the
<i>Avesta</i> under the name of Râman. The wind, according
to the <i>Avesta</i>, is not only the swiftest of the swift, but
the strongest of the strong (like the Marutas, Hanumant,
or Bhîmas, Hindoo winds, or sons of the wind). Even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the <i>Avesta</i>, he fights and assures the heroes of victory,
and is dear to woman and girls. (In the same way,
Sîtâ has a leaning for Hanumant, and Hidimbâ, of all
the Pâ&#7751;&#7693;avas, gives the preference to Bhîmas.) Moreover,
in the <i>Avesta</i>, girls invoke the wind in order to
obtain a husband.<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>A hymn of the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, however, celebrates a kind
of quarrel between the winds Marutas and the god Indras,
prompted by rivalry; a quarrel which ends in Indras
having the advantage. It is interesting to find in the
Persian tradition<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> the same rivalry between the wind
(vâta) and the son of Thrita, the hero Kereçâçpa. An
evil genie informs the wind that Kereçâçpa boasts of
being superior to him in strength. Thereupon the wind
begins to howl and rage in such a terrifying manner that
nothing can resist him, and the very trees are cleft in
two or torn up, till Kereçâçpa comes and squeezes him
so tightly in his arms that he is obliged to cease. This
interesting mythical incident is a prefigurement of the
loud whistle of the heroes and the monsters in fairy
tales, which is brought to an end in a summary fashion,
similar to that of the Persian legend; which also leads
us to suppose that Thraetaona vanquished the serpent
Dahâka, merely by tying him to the demoniacal mountain
Demâvend.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> This style of vanquishing the enemy
by binding him occurs often enough in the Persian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>legends and in the <i>Avesta</i> itself;<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> and is also mentioned
in the Hindoo traditions. The arrows of the monsters
hurled against the heroes of the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> bind them;
the god Yamas and the god Varu&#7751;as bind their victims;
the first draws tight, tightens the reins (<i>i.e.</i>, the evening
sun shortens his rays); the second envelops, covers and
binds with the darkness that which Yamas reined in.
The solar ray which shortens itself, the shadow which
advances, are images of the ensnarer of heroes; whereas
the solar ray which lengthens itself, the thunderbolt
which traverses all the heavens, surrounded by clouds
and darkness, represents the hero who grasps around,
presses tightly, and strangles the monster.</p>

<p>The bow of Mithra is formed of a thousand bows, prepared
from the tough hide of a cow; these bows, in the
<i>Avesta</i>, also hurl a thousand darts, which fly with winged
vultures' feathers.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> This carries us back again to the
Vedic myth of the birds which come out of the cow.</p>

<p>The bow being considered a cow, this cow sharpens its
horns; whence the <i>Khorda Avesta</i> celebrates the horned
darts of the bow of Mithra, <i>i.e.</i>, the horns of the cow,
which have become weapons<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> or the thunderbolts.</p>

<p>The legend of the two brothers is connected more with
the myth of the horse than with that of the cow or the
ox. But inasmuch as it presents the two brothers to
us as the one poor and the other rich, the riches are
symbolised by the ox. However, if I am not mistaken,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>there are two heroes, celebrated in the <i>Avesta</i> one after
the other (and whom I therefore suppose to be brothers),
who derive their origin from this legend; one is called
Çrîraokhsan (or who has a fine ox), the other Kereçaokhsan
(or who has a lean ox). As the <i>Avesta</i> does not go
on to develop this subject more in detail, I dare not
insist upon it; nevertheless it is gratifying to me to remark
that, of the two brothers, Kereçaokhsan was the
most valiant, as of the two brothers Urvâksha (a word
which may perhaps signify the one who has the fat horse,
and which is perhaps synonymous with Urvâçpa<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>) and
Kereçâçpa (he of the lean horse), it is the second who is
the glorious hero; as in the Russian popular tales, we
shall find the third brother, though thought to be an
idiot, despised by the others, and riding the worst
jade of the stable, yet becoming afterwards the most fortunate
hero. Kereçâçpa avenges his brother Urvâksha
against Hitâçpa, whom Professor Spiegel<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> interprets to
mean the bound horse, but which can also be rendered
he who keeps the horse bound, which would bring us
back again to the story of the bridle and of the hero-horse,
whom the demon keeps bound to himself, which
we have already noticed above in the story of the sacrifice
of Çuna&#7717;çepas, delivered by the aurora.</p>

<p>It is uncertain whether we must recognise the aurora
or the moon, in the <i>Avesta</i>, in the so-called Ashis Vag&#771;uhi,
the elevated (like Ardvî Çûra Anâhita), who appears upon
the high mountain, rich, beautiful, splendid, golden-eyed,
beneficent, giver of cattle, posterity, and abundance, who
discomfits the demons, guides chariots, and is invoked by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>the son of the watery one, Thraetaona, in the <i>Ashi Yast</i>,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>
in order that she may help him to vanquish the three-headed
monster-serpent Dahâka. Now, Thraetaona, the
victorious and rich in oxen,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> being a well-known form of
the solar hero Mithra, it is interesting to learn how the
heroine, the so-called Ashis Vag&#771;uhi (the aurora, or the
moon, as the three words Ardvî Çûra Anâhita are simple
names of the aurora), having the same supreme god for her
father, has three brothers, of whom the first is Çraosha,
the pious; the second, Rashnus, the strong; and the
third, Mithra, the victorious.</p>

<p>She is, moreover, herself represented as being pursued
by enemies on horseback; and it is now a bull, now a
sheep, now a child, anon a virgin who hides her from her
pursuers. Not knowing where to go, whether to ascend
into heaven, or creep along the earth, she applies to
Ahura Mazda, who answers that she must neither ascend
into heaven nor creep along the earth, but betake herself
to the middle of a beautiful king's habitation.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> How is
it possible not to recognise in her the moon, or the
aurora, who follows the path of the sun her husband,
the moon, or the aurora, who appears on the summit of
the high mountains?</p>

<p>Other facts not devoid of mythological interest might
perhaps be found in the <i>Avesta</i>, which, on account of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>uncertainty attending the translation of the original texts,
has hitherto been, it seems to me, utterly neglected by
mythologists. And yet, though Anquetil, Burnouf,
Benfey, Spiegel, Haugh, Kossowicz, and all who have
turned their talents and science to the interpretation of
the Zendic texts, disagree in the more abstruse passages,
there are many of which the interpretation is certain, in
which the learned translators agree, which offer interesting
mythological data, and permit us, in any case, to extract
from the <i>Avesta</i> an embryo of mythology, in the same
way as an embryo of grammar has already been extracted
from it. The brief references which I have now made to
the myth of the cow and the bull in the <i>Avesta</i>, anyhow
appear to me sufficient to warrant the conclusion I draw,
that the cow and the bull presented the same aspects,
and generated the same myths and the same beliefs in
Persia as in India, albeit in a form far more feeble and
indeterminate.</p>

<p>The solar hero of Persia occurs again in the costume
of historical legend in the Cyrus (&#922;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#962;) of Herodotus
and Ktesias, the first of which represents to us the child
exposed by his parents, saved and educated during his
infancy (like the Hindoo Kar&#7751;as, child of the sun, and
K&#7771;ish&#7751;as) among the shepherds, where for some time he
gives extraordinary proofs of his valour; the second
shows us the young hero who wins his own bride,
Amytis, daughter of Astyages.</p>

<p>Finally, the same hero appears in several splendid and
glorious forms in the <i>Shahname</i>.</p>

<p>As in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, Tritas or Trâitanas, and in the
<i>Avesta</i>, Thraetaona (of whom Thritas is a corresponding
form), accomplish the great exploit of killing the monster,
and more especially the serpent, so Feridun, the Persian
synonym (by means of the intermediate form Phreduna)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
for the Zendic Thraetaona is, in subsequent Persian
tradition, the most distinguished hero in the struggle
against the monster. I shall not insist upon the deeds of
Feridun and his mythical valour, after the learned paper
written upon the subject by Professor R. Roth, which
appears in the Transactions of the Oriental Society of
Leipzig, and the able and highly-valued essay by Professor
Michael Bréal on the myth of Hercules and
Cacus. I shall therefore content myself with quoting
from the legend of Feridun the episode of his old
age, which reminds us of the Vedic myth of the three
brothers.</p>

<p>The great king Feridun has three sons, Selm, Tûr,
and Ire&#501; (Selm, Tûr, and Er are also the sons of
Thraetaona); he divides the world into three parts and
gives the west to the first-born, and the north to the
second, whilst he keeps Iran for the youngest. The two
eldest are jealous, and announce to their father their intention
of declaring war against him, unless he expels
their younger brother Ire&#501; from the palace. Feridun
replies to their impious threat with haughty reproofs,
and meanwhile warns the young Ire&#501; of the danger he
is in. The youth proposes to go in person to his brothers,
and induce them to make peace; his father is unwilling
to let him go, but finally consents, and gives him a letter
for the two brothers, in which he commends him as
his best-loved son to their care. Ire&#501; arrives at his
brothers' dwelling; their soldiers see him, and cannot
take their eyes off him, as though they already recognised
him for their lord. Then Selm, the eldest, advises Tûr,
the second, the strong one, to kill Ire&#501;; Tûr thereupon
assaults the defenceless Ire&#501;, and transfixes his breast
with a dagger. Ire&#501; is afterwards avenged by the son
of his daughter (born after his death of a maid whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
had left pregnant), the hero Minu&#263;ehr, who kills Selm
and Tûr.</p>

<p>The hero who succeeds Minu&#263;ehr is Sal, the son of
Sam, whom, because born with white hair, his father had
exposed upon Mount Alburs, where the bird Simurg
nourished and saved him. Sal proves his wisdom before
Minu&#263;ehr by solving six astronomical riddles which
King Minu&#263;ehr proposes to him. The king, satisfied,
orders him to be dressed in festive clothes; he then, to
prove his strength, challenges him to run a tilt with the
horsemen; Sal is victorious, and obtains another robe of
honour and innumerable royal gifts; after which he
espouses Rudabe, daughter of King Mihrab.</p>

<p>Sal distinguishes himself, like Minu&#263;ehr, in his wars
against the perverse Turanians, the dragons and the
monsters, in which he takes along with him as his chief
helper the mighty hero Rustem, whose weapon is a club
surmounted with the head of a bull<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> or a horned mace
(the hero is the bull, the thunderbolts are his horns), and
whose horse is so powerful as by itself to fight and
vanquish a lion while Rustem is asleep. The hero himself
kills a dragon, and a witch transformed into a
beautiful woman, but who resumes her monstrous shape
as soon as the hero pronounces the name of a god. He
thunders like a cloud, is dark, and describes himself as a
thunder-cloud which hurls the thunderbolt.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> He binds
the warrior Aulad, and obliges him to reveal where the
demons detain in prison King Kawus, who is become
blind in their kingdom of darkness. Kawus then informs
Rustem that to recover his sight his eyes must be anointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>with three drops of blood from the slain demon Sefid;
upon which Rustem sets out to kill the demon. The
demons can be vanquished only by day; when it is
light, they sleep, and then they can be conquered, says
Aulad to Rustem; for this reason, Rustem does not
begin the enterprise till the sun is in mid-heaven;<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> then
he thunders and lightens at the demons. Like a sun, he
sets out towards the mountain (no doubt, towards sunset),
where the demon Sefid sits, and arrives at the mouth
of a deep and gloomy cavern, from which Sefid sallies
forth in the form of a black giant just awakened from
his sleep. The giant himself, like an enormous mountain
assaulting the earth, hurls a rock like a millstone at
Rustem; Rustem strikes the monster on the feet, and
lops away one of them; the lame giant continuing the
fight, Rustem at last wrestles with him, lifts him into
the air, then beats him several times furiously against
the ground, and so takes his life. He throws the body of
Sefid into the mountain cavern, whilst his blood saturates
the earth, and gives back to the prince Kawus his eyesight
and his splendour. The myth is a beautiful and an
expressive one. As from the black venomous serpent
comes white healthy milk, so from the black monster, at
his death, comes blood, which gives back his eyesight to
the blinded prince; the red aurora is here represented as
the blood of the nocturnal monster, discomfited by the
solar hero.</p>

<p>Let me ask the reader to notice the Persian comparison
of the rock thrown by the demon to a millstone, as it is
important to explain a superstition still extant in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
West, to the effect that the devil goes under the millstone
to carry out his evil designs. The stone or mountain
fractured by the waters was naturally compared to
a millstone moved by the waters; the demons inhabit
the cavernous mountain to guard the waters; thus the
devil, the evil one, the hobgoblins, prefer mills as their
dwellings.</p>

<p>Rustem fights, in the <i>Shahname</i>, many other victoriously
successful battles against Afrasiab the Turanian, and
other demoniacal beings, in the service of sundry heroic
kings, with epic incidents to boot, which are nearly all
uniform. His struggle against his son Sohrab, however,
is of an entirely different character.</p>

<p>Rustem goes to the chase. In the forest, Turkish bandits
rob him of his invaluable horse while he sleeps; he
then sets out, alone and sad, towards the city of Semengam,
following the track left by his horse. When he appears,
emerging from the wood, the king of Semengam and his
courtiers note the phenomenon as though it were the
sun coming out of the clouds of morning.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The king
receives Rustem with great hospitality, and, as if to fill
to the full the measure of his courtesy, he sends at night
to the room where he sleeps his exceedingly beautiful
daughter Tehmime. The hero and the beauty separate in
the morning; but Rustem, before parting from Tehmime,
leaves her a pearl of recognition. If a daughter is born
to their loves, she is to wear it as an amulet in her hair;
if a son, he is to wear it on his arm, and he will become
an invincible hero. After nine months, Tehmime gives
birth to Sohrab; at the age of one month he seems a
year old, at three years of age he amuses himself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
arms, at five he gives proof of a lion's courage, and at
ten he vanquishes all his companions, and asks his mother
to inform him of his father, threatening to kill her if she
does not tell him. Scarcely does Sohrab learn that he is
the son of Rustem, than he conceives the desire of becoming
king of Iran and supplanting Kawus; he then
commences his persecution of the Iranian heroes by
assaulting the white castle (the white morning sky, the
alba), defended by a beautiful warrior princess, Gurdaferid,
dear to the Iranian warriors. Sohrab conquers
and destroys the white castle, but in the moment of
triumph, the warrior maiden disappears. The old hero
Rustem then moves against his own son Sohrab; the
latter throws him down, but Rustem, in his turn, mortally
wounds Sohrab. In the old Rustem thrown down on
the mountain it is not difficult to recognise the setting
sun; in Sohrab mortally wounded by Rustem, the sun
itself, which dies; and in fact, the dying sun has a different
appearance from the new sun which rises and
triumphs in the heavens: these two appearances might
give rise to the idea of a struggle between the old and
the young sun, in which both are sacrificed. Indeed,
Rustem feels, when he mortally wounds Sohrab, that he
is wounding himself; he curses his work and immediately
sends for a healing balsam; but in the meantime Sohrab
dies. The only one who could destroy the young sun
was the old sun; the sun grows old and dies; Rustem
alone could kill Sohrab. With the death of Sohrab the
glory of Rustem is also eclipsed; he retires unto solitude,
and the most grandiose period of his epic life comes to an
end. After this he only reappears in episodic battles or
enterprises; as, for instance, in his setting fire to Turan,
in which he resembles Hanumant, burner of Lañkâ; in
the liberation of the young hero Bishen, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
taken prisoner and incarcerated by the Turanians; in the
killing of the powerful and perverse Turanian Afrasiab;
and in his own death in an ambuscade set by young
rivals of the old lion, who dies taking vengeance on his
enemies.</p>

<p>In the very palace of Kawus (he who was protected
by Rustem), a notable legendary drama takes place.
Sijavush, son of King Kawus, is seduced by the queen-mother
Sudabe, who burns with love for him. The
youth spurns this love, upon which she accuses him to
King Kawus as her seducer. The father, after hearing
his son's defence in proof of his innocence, cannot believe
the queen; and thereupon she devises another method
for destroying the young Sijavush. She concerts with a
slave she has, who is a sorceress, and persuades her to
create two little venomous monsters, which she straightway
proclaims aloud are the children of Sijavush. Then
Sijavush, to prove his innocence, submits willingly to the
trial by fire; he enters the flames upon his black horse,
after having embraced his trembling father; both horse
and horseman come out of the immense fire, amid the
plaudits of all the spectators. Then the king gives orders
to strangle the unnatural queen; but his son Sijavush
intercedes in her favour, and Sudabe is allowed to live
by grace of the young prince, whom, however, she continues
to persecute, till, on the death of Sijavush, Rustem,
who bewailed him as his own son, or as his other self,
avenges him first by killing Sudabe, on account of
whom Sijavush had been obliged to repair to Turan,
and afterwards by carrying the war into Turan, where,
after a very agitated life, Sijavush had fallen into the
power of his father-in-law, Afrasiab, and been put to
death.</p>

<p>The wife of Sijavush, Ferengis by name, being pregnant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
is hospitably entertained by Piran, and gives birth
to the hero Kai Khosru; and no sooner is he born than
he is consigned to the shepherds of the mountain. As
early as seven years of age, his favourite amusement is
that of drawing the bow; at ten, he confronts wild boars,
bears, lions, and tigers with only his shepherd's staff.
When Afrasiab sees the young shepherd, he inquires at
him about his sheep and the peaceful pursuits of shepherds;
the boy replies with stories of lions having sharp
teeth, and of other wild animals, of which he is not afraid.
As soon as he comes to manhood, he flees from Turan,
followed by the Turanians; he arrives at the banks of a
river, where the ferryman asks impossible conditions to
take him over; upon which, like Feri&#7693;un, he crosses the
river safely, but without a boat, and on dry feet (it is the
sun traversing the cloudy and gloomy ocean without
wetting himself);<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> arrived at length in Iran, he is feasted
and fêted as the future king. His reign begins; he then
assigns different tasks to different heroes, among whom
is his brother Firud, born of another mother, of whom it
is said that a single hair of his head has more strength in
it than many warriors (one ray of the sun is enough to
break the darkness). One evening, however, at sunset,
Firud is killed in his castle upon the mountain, being
surrounded by a crowd of enemies, after having lost his
horse, and after his mother Cerire had dreamt that a fire
had consumed both mountain and castle. His mother
Cerire (the evening aurora) throws herself among the
flames with her maids, and dies also. Kai Khosru bewails
the loss of his brother Firud all the night through,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
till the cock crows; when morning comes he thinks of
avenging him.</p>

<p>After this, the life of Kai Khosru is consumed in
battles fought by his heroes against the Turanians.
Only towards the end of his days does he become a
penitent king; he will no longer allow his subjects to
fight, and his only occupation is prayer; he takes leave
of his people and his daughters in peace, ascends a
mountain, and disappears in a tempest, leaving no trace
of himself. In a similar manner the heroes Yudhish&#7789;hiras,
Cyrus, and Romulus disappear (not to speak of the
biblical Moses, still less of Christ, as we do not wish to
complicate a comparison of which the materials are
already so extensive, by mixing up the Aryan elements
with those of Semitic origin; although the legends of
the serpent, of Noah, of Abraham and his regained wife,
of Abraham and his son Isaac, of Joseph and his brethren,
of Joshua, of Job, and other and more recent biblical
heroes, by their mythical or astronomical import, present
numerous analogies with the Indo-European legends); in
a similar manner, the old sun, weary of reigning in the
heavens and fighting for his life, becomes invisible every
evening on the mountain-peaks.</p>

<p>The <i>Shahname</i> contains numerous other legends besides
those which we have thus far briefly described; and one
of the most notable is, beyond a doubt, that of Isfendiar,
who goes with his brother Bishutem to deliver his two
sisters, imprisoned in a fortress by the Turanian king
Ardshasp. The seven adventures of Isfendiar, <i>i.e.</i>, his
meeting with the wolf, the lion, the dragon, the witch
(who makes herself beautiful, but who is no sooner bound
with the enchanted necklace of Isfendiar [the solar disc]
than she becomes old and ugly again), the gigantic bird,
the tempest and the river, all of which dangers he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
victoriously overcomes, are reproductions, in an analogous
form too, of the seven adventures of Rustem.</p>

<p>Finally, the legend of Iskander or Iskender (the name
of Alexander of Macedon), full of extraordinary adventures,
became exceedingly popular in Persia, and thence,
no doubt, passed with all its charms into Europe. The
audacity and good fortune, the glory and the power of the
great conqueror were the reasons why there grouped
round his name so many extraordinary stories, which
wandered dispersedly through the world without epic
unity. To make up one glorious and never-to-be-forgotten
hero, were combined together the achievements
of many anonymous or nearly forgotten ones. The
Persian <i>Iskendername</i> of Nishâmi, is, as its name denotes,
entirely taken up with the celebration of the deeds
of the Macedonian hero, of which the most illustrious are
the liberation of the princess Nushâbe (taken prisoner by
the Russians), and the voyage in search of the fountain
of life and immortality, which, however, Iskander cannot
find. From Persia the same legend afterwards passed,
with new disguises, into Egypt, Armenia, and Greece,
whence it was diffused during the middle ages over
almost the whole of Western Europe.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>As a bridge of transition between the Hindoo and
Persian, and the Turk or Tartar traditions, we shall make
use of three works: the Turkish version<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> of the Persian
<i>Tuti-Name</i>, itself a translation and in part a paraphrase
of the Hindoo <i>Çuka-Saptatî</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the seventy (stories) of
the parrot; the Mongol stories of <i>Siddhi-kûr</i>, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>Mongol history of <i>Ardshi-Bordshi Khân</i>,<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> the first being
a paraphrase of the Hindoo <i>Vetâla-Pa&#324;&#263;avinçatî</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the
twenty-five of the Vetâla (a kind of demon), and the
second of the Hindoo <i>Vikrama-&#263;aritram</i> (the heroic
action).</p>

<p>We have seen in the <i>Âitareya Brahmânam</i> the father
who prepares to offer up his son, and in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,
the son who forfeits youth that his father may
live. In the <i>Tuti-Name</i>,<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> the faithful Merdi Gânbâz
prepares to sacrifice his wife and sons, and afterwards
himself, to prolong the life of the king; but his devotion
and fidelity being proved, he is arrested by God before
he can accomplish the cruel sacrifice, and receives numberless
benefits from the king.</p>

<p>In the story of the goldsmith and the woodcutter, the
<i>Tuti-Name</i><a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> reproduces the two brothers or friends, of
whom one is wicked, rich, and avaricious, while the
other is defrauded of the money due to him, because,
though, in reality intelligent, he is supposed to be an
idiot. The woodcutter avenges himself upon the goldsmith
by a plan which we shall find described in the
legend of the bear, and recovers, thanks to his craftiness,
the gold which his brother or friend had kept from him.</p>

<p>In the interesting story of Merhuma,<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> we read of the
wife who is persecuted by the seducer her brother-in-law.
To avenge her refusal, he causes her to be stoned during
the absence of his brother; being innocent, she rises
again from under the stones; being sheltered by a
Bedouin, a monster of a slave seduces her; being repulsed,
he accuses her of the death of the Bedouin's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>little son, whom he had himself killed; the beautiful
girl flees away; she frees a youth who was condemned
to death, and who in his turn seduces her. She then
embarks in a ship; while she is at sea all the sailors become
enamoured of her and wish to possess her; she
invokes the god who caused Pharaoh to be drowned and
who saved Noah from the waters. The waves begin to
move; a thunderbolt descends and burns to ashes all who
are in the ship, with the exception of the beautiful girl,
who lands safe and sound upon the shore (it is the aurora
coming out of the gloomy ocean of night, and the monsters
who persecute her are burned to ashes by the
thunderbolts and the sun's rays); she thence escapes
into a convent, in which she ministers to the unfortunate,
cures the lame, and gives eyesight to the blind.
Among the latter is her persecutor, the brother of her
husband; she pardons him and gives him back his eyesight;
in the same way she cures all her other persecutors.
It is scarcely necessary for me to remind the
reader how this oriental tale, which developed itself
from the myth of the persecuted and delivering
aurora which we have seen in the Vedic hymns, reappears
in numerous very popular western legends, of
which Crescentia and Geneviève are the most brilliant
types.</p>

<p>The aurora comes out of the gloomy ocean and is
espoused by the sun; these heavenly nuptials in proximity
to the sea gave rise to the popular tale<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> of the king who
wishes the sea with its pearls to be present at his nuptials;
the pearls of the bride-aurora are supposed to come
out of the sea of night. The sea sends as gifts to the
king a casket of pearls, a chest of precious dresses, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
horse that goes like the morning wind, and a chest full
of gold.</p>

<p>The wise aurora figures again in the story of the ingenious
princess<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> who discovers, by means of a story-riddle,
the robbers who, during the night, stole the
precious gem destined for the king.</p>

<p>The aurora imparts splendour and eyesight to the
blinded sun. The story of the three-breasted princess
who, while she meditates poisoning the blind man, in
order that she may enjoy unrestrained the affections of
her young and handsome lover, relents and gives him
back his sight, reappears in a rather incomplete form in
the <i>Tuti-Name</i>.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>The girl who has been married to a monster, whom
she flees from to follow a handsome young lover, who,
arriving at the banks of a river, despoils her of her riches,
leaves her naked and passes over to the other side, after
which she resigns herself to her fate and resolves to return
to her husband the monster,<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> represents the evening
aurora, who flees before the monster of night to follow her
lover the sun, who, in the morning, after adorning himself
with her splendour, leaves her on the shore of the gloomy
ocean and runs away, the aurora being thereupon obliged
in the evening to re-unite herself to her husband the
monster. It is interesting, moreover, as bearing upon our
subject, to note the expression of which the youth who
flees with the beautiful woman makes use to express his
fear of discovery. He says that the monster-husband
will follow them, and that should he sit upon the horns
of the bull (the moon) he would be sure to recognise him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>The story of two young people fleeing upon a bull, and
followed by the monster, occurs again in the Russian
popular tales. By the horns of the bull, the youth means
the most prominent and visible situation; and he knows,
moreover, that if the monster overtakes them, he will be
sure to demonstrate the truth of the brave proverb which
advises us in arduous undertakings to take the bull by
the horns.</p>

<p>It is also the aurora who is represented by the beautiful
maiden<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> whom her father, mother, and brother have,
without each other's knowledge, severally affianced to
three youths of different professions. The three young
men contend for her person, but while the quarrel is undecided,
the girl dies. The three then go to visit her
tomb; one discovers her body, the second finds that there
is still some life in her, and the third strikes her and
raises her up alive, upon which the quarrel is resumed.
She flees from them, and withdraws into another living
tomb, a convent. In the most popular form of this
legend the three companions, or three brothers, fighting
for the bride, divide her; the aurora is torn into pieces
as soon as the sun, her true lover and rightful suitor,
appears.</p>

<p>From darkness comes forth light; from the old, the
young; from death, life; from the dust of a dead man's
skull, tasted by a virgin, is born a wonderful child, who
knows how to distinguish false pearls from real, dishonest
women from honest ones<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> (the morning sun can distinguish
between light and darkness); the wise boy (the
young sun) is the brother of the wise girl (the young
aurora). The flesh of a killed Brâhman is turned into
gold in another story of the <i>Tuti-Name</i>.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>We have seen that the aurora and the sun are mother
and son, brother and sister, or lover and mistress. The
sun in the evening dies ignominiously, is sacrificed and
hanged upon a gibbet, and with himself sacrifices his
mother or his mistress. The legend is popular and
ancient which speaks of the robber son, when about to
end his life upon a gibbet,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> biting the nose off his mother,
who gave birth to him and brought him up badly. In
the <i>Tuti-Name</i>,<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> it is the young adulterer (and robber
too) who, condemned to death for his adultery, asks to see
his mistress once more before his death and kiss her, and
who, as she does so, gratifies his revenge by inflicting
upon her a like indignity. It is remarkable how, even
in the Hindoo popular tale, the story of the adulterer is
confounded with that of a thief; the adulterer ends by
being thrown into the water (the sun and the aurora
fall into the gloomy ocean of night).</p>

<p>In the next story it is the wicked husband who, travelling
with his rich wife for change of dwelling-place,
despoils her of her clothes, and then throws her into a
well in order to ensure possession of her jewels and wardrobe.
These riches, however, do not last long; he becomes
poor and goes begging alms, dressed as a mendicant,
until he finds his wife again, who had been saved by
divine intervention from the well, and provided anew with
clothes and jewels of equal gorgeousness. The husband
passes some time with his wife, and then sets out again
on a voyage with her; he arrives at the same well, and
throws her in as before to enjoy alone her stripped-off
garnitures and riches. (The meaning of the myth is evident;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>it is the sun throwing the splendid aurora into the
gloomy waters of the night.)</p>

<p>A king becomes enamoured of the beauteous Mahrusa;<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
his councillors tear him from his love, upon which he
pines away in solitude and dies. The beautiful girl
unites herself to him in the grave (Romeo and Juliet,
the evening aurora and the sun die together).</p>

<p>The story of the three brothers, the &#7770;ibhavas, occurs
again in the <i>Tuti-Name</i>,<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> with other particulars which
we already know. The first brother is the wise one; the
second is a maker of talismans (amongst other things he
can make a horse which will run in one day over a space
of ground that would take other horses thirty); the third
and youngest brother is the victorious archer. They set
out to search for the beautiful maiden who has fled by
night from the house of her father. The first brother discovers,
by his wisdom, that the maiden was carried off by
the fairies into an island-mountain which men cannot
reach. The second creates a wonderful animal upon
which to traverse the intervening waters (Christophoros
or Bhîmas). Having arrived at the island-mountain, the
third and youngest brother fights the demon, the lord of
the fairies, vanquishes him, and frees the beautiful girl,
who thereupon is conducted back to her father. Then
there arises the usual quarrel between the three brothers
as to who is to possess the bride.</p>

<p>In the Vedâs, we have the sky and the moon represented
as a cup. From the little cup of abundance
(the moon) it is easy to pass to the miraculous little
pipkin (the moon), in which the kind-hearted but poor
housekeeper of the Pâ&#7751;&#7693;avas, in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, still
finds abundance of vegetables, after her powers of hospitality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>had been exhausted on the god K&#7771;ish&#7751;as disguised
as a beggar&mdash;to the pipkin from which can be taken
whatever is wished for. In the <i>Tuti-Name</i>,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> a woodcutter
finds ten magicians round a pipkin, and eating out
of it as much and whatever they want; they are pleased
with the woodcutter, and, at his request, give him the
pipkin. He invites his acquaintances to a banquet at
his house, but not able to contain himself for joy, he
places the pipkin upon his head, and begins to dance.
The pipkin falls to the ground and is broken to
pieces, and with it his fortune vanishes (the story of
Perrette).</p>

<p>A variation of the small cup is the wooden porringer
(the moon), which two brothers (the Açvinâu) dispute for,
in the history of the king of China,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> and from which can
be taken whatever drink and food is wished for; as, in
the same story, we find the enchanted shoes which carry
us in an instant wherever we wish to go;&mdash;which brings
us back to the fugitive Vedic aurora, the swiftest in the
race, and to the popular tales relating to Cinderella, who
is overtaken and found again by the prince only when
she has lost her enchanted slipper. With the porringer
and the enchanted shoes we find, in the popular tales, the
little purse full of money which fills again as fast as it is
emptied (another form of the cup of abundance), and a
sword which, when unsheathed, causes a fine, rich, and
great city to arise in a desert, which city disappears
when the sword is put back into the sheath (the solar
ray is the drawn sword, which makes the luminous city
of the rich aurora arise; scarcely does the sun's ray
vanish, or scarcely is the sword sheathed, than the marvellous
city vanishes). The rest of the story is also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>interesting, because it applies to three men a double and
well-known fable of the animals which contend for the
prey (as the three brothers contend for the beautiful
maiden whom they have found again). The animals
cannot divide it equally; they refer to the judgment of
a man passing by; he divides it so well that the animals
are ever after grateful to him, and help him in every
danger. The story of the <i>Tuti-Name</i> touches upon this
form of the myth, but soon abandons it for another
equally zoological, and a more familiar one, that of the
third who comes in between two that quarrel, and enjoys
the prey. The young adventurer undertakes to put an end
to the dispute of the two brothers as to the division of
the purse, the porringer, the sword and the wonderful
shoes; he does so by putting the shoes on his feet and
fleeing away with the other three articles contended for
(the two brothers Açvinâu, the two twilights, contend for
the moon and also for the aurora, as we shall see better
in the next chapter; the sun puts an end to their quarrel
by espousing her himself).</p>

<p>We are already familiar with the Vedic &#7770;ibhavas
who out of one cup make four. Probably upon this legend
depends that of the four brothers of the <i>Tuti-Name</i>,<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
who, as they let each a pearl fall from their forehead
upon the ground, see four mines open, one of copper, the
second of silver, the third of gold (the third brother is
here again the favourite), the fourth only of iron. The
gem appears to be the sun itself. The four mines seem to
me to represent respectively the coppery sky in the evening,
the silver sky in the moonlight night, the sky in
the morning, golden with the dawn, and the iron sky, the
grey or azure, of the day. The word <i>nîlas</i> in Sanskrit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
means azure, as well as black, and between azure and
black is grey, the colour of iron.</p>

<p>Of the three brothers, the most learned, he who solves
the enigmas, is often the eldest; and in the story of the
<i>Tuti-Name</i>,<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> the eldest of the three brothers explains why
old men have white hair, saying that this whiteness is a
symbol of the clearness of their thoughts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let us now pass to the Calmuc and Mongol stories of
<i>Siddhi-kûr</i>, which, as we have said above, are also of
Hindoo origin.</p>

<p>In the first story, the three companions, forming at
first three groups of two, have resolved into six. The
night-time is divided into three, into six, into seven (six,
<i>plus</i> an extraordinary one, born afterwards), into nine
(three groups of three), into twelve (three groups of
four). Hence, near the monster with three, six, seven,
nine, or twelve heads, we find sometimes three, sometimes
six, seven, nine, twelve brother-heroes. The
last head (or the last two, three, or four heads) of the
monster, the decisive one, is the most difficult, and even
dangerous, to cut off; the last of the brothers is he who,
by cutting it off, is victorious. In the first Calmuc story
of <i>Siddhi-kûr</i>, six brothers or companions separate where
six rivers take their rise, and go in search of fortune.
The first-born perishes; the second, by means of his
wisdom (he partakes of the wisdom of the first-born, with
whom he is grouped), discovers the place where the dead
one is buried; the third, the strong one, breaks the rock
under which the eldest is hidden; the fourth resuscitates
him by means of a health-bringing drink, as Bhîmas, the
strong hero of the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, arises again when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
drinks the water of health and strength; the fifth brother
creates a bird, which the sixth colours; this bird flies to
the bride of the eldest brother, and brings her among
his companions, who, finding her exceedingly beautiful,
become, one and all, enamoured of her; they fight for
her, and, that each may have a part, end by cutting
her to pieces. We already know the mythical meaning
of this legend.</p>

<p>The third and fourth Calmuc tales introduce explicitly
the bull and the cow. In the third, a man who possesses
but one cow unites himself to her, in order to make her
fruitful. Of this union a tailed monster is born, having
a man's body and a bull's head. The man-bull (Minotauros)
goes into the forest, where he finds three companions&mdash;one
black, one green, and one white&mdash;who
accompany him. The man-bull overcomes the enchantments
of a dwarf witch; his three companions lower him
into a well and leave him there, but he escapes. He
meets a beautiful maiden drawing water, at whose every
footstep a flower arises; he follows her, and finally finds
himself in heaven; he fights against the demons, in
favour of the gods, and dies in this enterprise. This
story, of Hindoo origin, where the bull and the cow take
the place of the hero and the maiden, appears to me to
justify the amplitude of the comparisons.</p>

<p>We have already seen the beneficial qualities of the
excrement of the cow. In the fourth story, it is under
the excrement of a cow that the enchanted gem, lost by
the daughter of the king, is found. It is of the cow that
the pearl is the secretion. The moon-cow and the aurora-cow
are rich in pearls; they are pearls themselves, like
the sun; the sun comes out of the aurora, the pearl comes
out of the cow.</p>

<p>The subject of the seventh tale is the three sisters who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
taking the cattle to pasture, lose a buffalo, or black bull.
In their search for it, they came across an enchanted castle,
tenanted by a white bird, who offers to marry them. The
third sister consents, and marries him. The bird turns out
then to be a handsome cavalier (a form of Lohengrin).
But having, by the advice of a witch, burned the aviary,
she loses him, and cannot recover him till the aviary is
restored. We shall see the sun as a bird in the Vedic
hymns; the aurora is the aviary, made of flames, of this
divine bird. When the aviary is burned at morn, the
aurora and the sun separate; they meet again in the
evening, when the aviary is reconstructed.</p>

<p>Another beautiful myth of analogous import occurs
again in the eighth story. A woodman and a painter
envy each other; the painter makes the king believe that
the woodman's father, who is in heaven, has written
ordering his son to repair to paradise, in order to build
him a temple, and to take the route that the painter shall
indicate. The king orders the woodman to set out for
paradise. The painter prepares a funeral pyre, by way
of exit; from this the woodman succeeds in escaping,
and, going back to the king, he tells him that he has
been to paradise, and presents a letter which his father
has given him, ordering the painter to come by the same
road, and paint the temple. The king requires the summons
to be obeyed, and the perfidious painter perishes
in the flames. The morning sun emerges safe and sound
from the flames of the morning aurora; the evening sun
passes through those flames, and dies.</p>

<p>The tenth Calmuc tale gives us the myth of the two
brothers; the rich one avaricious and wicked, and the poor
one virtuous. The story ends in a manner analogous to
that of the dying adulterer, who, as we have seen in the
<i>Tuti-Name</i>, bites off his mistress's nose.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>The eleventh story is a variation of that of the lover,
or husband, who abandons or kills his wife, after having
despoiled her of her riches; but instead of the waters of
the sea, we have here the sea of sand, the sandy desert,
in a cavity of which is deposited the young girl, shut up
in a chest, the same chest which in other popular tales
drifts about on the surface of the water.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> But into the
place where it was laid, the chest having been taken away
by a young prince, a tiger enters; the unworthy husband
turns up himself to abstract the chest, and is torn to
pieces by the tiger. The sterile night is a vast desert, a
sea of waters, a sea of sand; the sun-prince frees the
aurora from the waters, out of the well, or the cavern of
the desert; the tiger kills the monster-husband.</p>

<p>In the twelfth tale, a thief steals the enchanted gem
from the prince; he throws the gem to the ground, the
consequence of which is that the prince's nose bleeds so
excessively that he dies. The nose is the most prominent
part of the face, the most conspicuous and splendid part;
it is the gem of the sun-prince. The sun falls at night
upon the mountain; the gem falls to the ground; the
prince's nose bleeds; he has struck his nose against the
ground, and it bleeds. The sun-prince dies, and the
evening sky is tinged red, blood-colour; the sun, who
loses his blood in the evening, dies.</p>

<p>The thirteen Calmuc stories are followed by ten Mongol
tales; in all, twenty-three, of which the sixteenth, however,
is lost.</p>

<p>The fourteenth tells us of the rich and avaricious man
whose poor brother goes in despair into the forest to die
upon a rock; but his presence not being known to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
spirits, he has the good luck to come upon a hammer and
a sack, of which the former, when struck against an
object, produces whatever is desired by the owner, the
latter being used to carry away the objects thus obtained,
this hammer and this sack having been left there by the
hobgoblins. Thus the poor brother becomes rich, and is
envied by the other, who goes to the same place, in hopes
of experiencing the same good fortune; but as he does
not hide himself, the hobgoblins see him, and believing
him to be the man who stole the hammer and the sack,
avenge themselves upon him by lengthening his nose,
and covering it with protuberances. To this myth may
perhaps be referred the origin of the Italian expression,
"Restare con uno o due palmi di naso," to remain with
one or two spans of the nose; that is to say, to be laughed
at, and with the gesture by which derision is accompanied,
and which is addressed to the man who is laughed
at, by applying one or sometimes both hands to the
end of one's nose. The poor brother, now rich, visits
the miserly brother, who has a long nose covered with
protuberances, and knocks them off with his hammer.
He had already knocked off eight, and only one remained,
when, at his wife's request, he desisted and left the last
one on. The rich man's wife, seeing how the protuberances
had been taken off by striking them, tries
herself to remove the last one, and strikes it with a
hammer; but not calculating her aim accurately, she
splits her husband's head open, and he dies.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth Mongol story, an old man and an
old woman have nine cows. The old man is fond of
meat, and eats all the calves; the old woman, on the
other hand, has a great liking for milk and butter, with
which she satiates herself. When the old man has eaten
all the calves, he thinks that one cow more or less will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
not affect his wealth; reasoning thus, he eats all the cows
except one, which he spares out of respect for the whim
of his old wife. But one day that the old woman is
out, the old man cannot resist the temptation, and kills
the last cow. His wife returns, is angry, and abandons
him, upon which he throws after her one of the cow's
breasts. The woman, in grateful memory of the milk and
butter she liked so much, takes it up and goes up the
mountain, where she strikes the cow's breast against the
summit of the rock, and thereupon there flow out milk
and butter in rivers. She satisfies her appetite, and then
remembers that her husband is perhaps dying of hunger,
feeding, as he does, upon ashes; she therefore, but secretly,
throws butter into the house down the chimney, and then
disappears. In this attention the old man recognises the
love of his wife, and resolves upon the plan of following
her footsteps during the night upon the snow. He comes
to the mountain, sees the breast, and cannot resist the
temptation it offers; he eats it, and takes the butter
away with him. The old woman wanders about till she
comes upon a herd of deer, who pasture freely, and who,
instead of fleeing, let themselves be milked. Again, she
thinks of her husband, and she throws deer's butter down
the chimney. The old man follows her over the snow,
finds her near the deer, and kills them in his inordinate
passion for meat. The old woman continues to wander
about, and stumbles this time upon a cavern of the wild
beasts, guarded by a hare. The hare defends her from
the wild beasts; but she then conceives the idea of giving
her husband a stick, and throws it down the chimney
whilst he is taking the ashes up with a spoon. He follows
her, and comes to the cave of the wild animals, who, seeing
them arrive together, tear them to pieces. Here again we
have the myth of the sun and the aurora (or the fine season);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
the hare who guards the cavern and tames the wild
beasts is, as we shall see in the chapter which treats of it,
the moon, the cows and the deer being the same. The
ferocious animals of the cavern of night rend both sun and
aurora (or fine season), both old man and old woman.</p>

<p>The eighteenth Mongol story is too indecent for me to
relate, or for the reader to peruse; suffice it to say, that
we have in it a comic variation of the Amazon heroine,
and that this heroine calls herself Sûrya (the sun) Bagatur
(to which corresponds the bagatír; or hero, of the
Russians).</p>

<p>In the twentieth tale we have a calf and a lion's whelp
brought up together by a lioness upon the same milk.<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
When grown, the lion goes and inhabits the forest, or the
desert, and the bull, the mountain illumined by the sun,
meeting as good friends and brothers to drink the same
water. This good understanding is, however, put an end
to by their perfidious uncle the fox, who persuades the
lion to believe that the bull designs to kill him, and adds
that when the bull in the morning strikes the ground
with his horns, and bellows loudly, will be the sign that
he is going to carry his purpose into effect; he then tells
the bull that the lion has a similar design against him.
In the morning, when the two brothers, bull and lion, go
to drink the same water, they approach each other with
suspicion, engage in battle and kill each other, the fox, or
wolf, being the only one to benefit by the quarrel. This
is a form of the story of the two twilights (the Açvinâu),
which we shall illustrate in the following chapter.</p>

<p>The beginning of the twenty-first Mongol story offers
a new analogy with the apologue of Perrette.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> A poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>father and mother find a little lamb's-wool; they consult
together, and resolve with the wool to make cloth, and
with the cloth to buy an ass. Upon this ass they will
place their little child, and go a-begging; by begging they
will become yet richer, and buy another ass. Of the two, a
young ass will be born. The youngster immediately exclaims
that if a young donkey is born he will ride upon it;
whereupon his mother answers, "You would break its
back," when, accompanying these words with the movement
of a stick, she strikes the youngster's head with it,
and kills him; with him the fine projects of the poor
parents also vanish.</p>

<p>In the last of the stories of <i>Siddhi-kûr</i>, which is joined
to the three legends of the grateful animals, the disguises,
and the laughing princess, a man uses the horns of his
dead buffalo to grub up the roots upon which he lives in
exile.</p>

<p>The history of <i>Ardshi-Bordshi</i> also contains several
interesting stories.</p>

<p>It begins with a challenge among the children who
keep the king's cows to run a race from the summit of a
mountain. The first who comes to the winning-post is
honoured as a king by his companions for that day, and
acts and judges on the spot where the race takes place
as a real king; indeed, he judges and decides as a court
of final appeal on cases which have not been well
examined by the great king of the country. He unmasks
and convicts robbers and false witnesses acquitted
by the king as innocent, and sends a missive to the king,
recommending him to be more cautious in future in his
judgments, or else to resign his royal dignity. The great
king wonders at the extraordinary wisdom of the king of
the children, and ascribes his preternatural sagacity to
the magical influence of the mountain where the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
who guard the cows play their games. On another
occasion, the king of the children, by his craftiness,
detects a demon in one whom the king had thought to
be the legitimate son of his minister. The discovery is
made by means of a challenge to the minister's real son
and his demoniacal counterfeit to get into a small jug at
hand. The real son cannot; but the supposititious makes
himself small and enters the jug, in which the king of
the children shuts him up with a diamond, and administers
thereupon fresh reproof to the great king for his
carelessness. The great king then visits the mountain of
the children, and sees a golden throne with thirty-two
steps emerge from the ground; upon each step there is a
wooden puppet (the moon). The great king has the
throne carried into his palace, and endeavours to ascend
it; the puppets arrest him, and one of them tells him
that this was once the throne of the god Indras, and
afterwards of King Vikramâdityas. The great king
inclines himself in reverence, and one of the puppets
begins to narrate the history of Vikramâdityas.</p>

<p>The history of Vikramâdityas, narrated by the puppets,
refers to a wise child, born of the wife of the king,
after she had eaten a cake made of earth mixed with oil,
and dissolved in water in a porcelain vase (of which cake
the servant-maid eats the remainder). The young Vikramâdityas
passes his infancy in the forests, where he learns
all the arts, not excluding the art of thieving, taught him
by the most experienced robbers, as well as every kind of
mercantile fraud; by cheating, he becomes possessed of
an enchanted gem which was in the hip of a dead man,
and of a child who has the faculty of understanding the
language of the wolves, and who calls himself son of the
wolves, but was, in fact, born by the roadside of the maid
who had eaten the rest of the cake; this child is nursed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
by his mother, and although at first ill-favoured, becomes
in the long run very handsome. Vikramâdityas afterwards
kills the king of the demons in battle, in which it
is remarkable that as many new demons arise to combat
him as there are pieces into which the hero cuts the
demon, until the hero multiplies himself in his turn, and
to every demon opposes a lion sprung from his own body.
Vikramâdityas mounts upon a throne where those who
had sat before him had all perished, each after a reign
of twenty-four hours, because they had omitted to offer
up funeral sacrifices to the dead during the night;
Vikramâdityas, with his companion, the son of the wolf,
fulfils the sacred duty, and escapes death.</p>

<p>In the same story, which reminds us of the <i>&#7770;ibhavas</i>
and the four cups and the cow, four young shepherds, one
after another, work at the same piece of wood; one gives
it the general shape of a woman, the second colours it,
the third imparts the features peculiar to the feminine
form, and the fourth gives it life; they then dispute for
her person. The case is referred to the king; a wise
man pronounces that the two first who worked the wood
are the father and mother, the third is the priest, the
fourth, who gave it life, is the legitimate husband. Thus
the four become three, by making a group of the first
two.</p>

<p>Next comes the legend of the wife who, taking her
husband by the feet, makes him fall into a fountain,
because she hears a melodious voice, perhaps an echo of
her own, which charms her; she sees a monster instead,
and bewails her lost husband. In zoological mythology,
the fable of the dog who, at the sight of his own shadow,
lets the meat drop into the river, is analogous to this
legend, which, however, we introduce here, only because
of its relation to the similar stories of the wife who kills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
her husband, and of the husband who kills his wife by
throwing her into the water, already vaguely hinted at
in the Vedic hymns.</p>

<p>The last of the tales contained in the history of <i>Ardshi
Bordshi</i> shows us, on the other hand, a far too complaisant
wife. A king has a daughter, named Light of
the sun, who is to be seen by no one. The daughter
asks to be allowed to go out into the city to walk on the
15th of the month (at full moon); this granted, the king
orders every one to stay that day in his house, and all
the doors and windows to be shut; and capital punishment
is the penalty of disobeying the king's command.
(The like occurs again in the British legend of Godiva,
the Countess of Mercia, in the eleventh century.) A
minister, Ssaran by name (moon), cannot repress his
curiosity, and observes her from a balcony; the girl
makes signs to him, inviting him to join her; the wife
of the inquisitive minister interprets the signs to him,
and urges him to overtake the beautiful girl, giving him,
at parting, a pearl of recognition. Light of the sun and
Light of the moon meet at the foot of a tree, and spend the
night until sunrise in amorous dalliance. One of the persons
employed to guard the princess discovers this intrigue,
and denounces it before the king; the wife of the minister
Ssaran ascertains, by means of the pearl, that her husband
is in danger; she rejoins him, disguises and disfigures
him, suggesting a formula of oath by which Light of the
sun swears that it was the monster, and the monster only
she embraced; which seeming impossible to the king
and courtiers, the minister Ssaran and Light of the sun
are acquitted. (The aurora, or the sun, hides during the
night, and no one sees, no one is allowed to see her;
the god Lunus shows himself; he remains during the
night with the sun, or with the solar aurora, whom no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
one can see during the night; the god Lunus then
transforms and disfigures himself, so that he becomes
unrecognisable, invisible; the guilty one glides away,
and escapes; it then seems impossible that the god
Lunus, who is no longer seen, can have been with the
light of the sun; their loves having come to an end,
the adulterers being separated, their guilt is no longer
believed, their innocence is recognised, and the morality
of the myth is left to take care of itself as best it can.)</p>

<p>But the Calmuc and Mongol stories <i>Siddhi-kûr</i>, and
the history of <i>Ardshi Bordshi</i>, being, as they are, only
paraphrases of Hindoo tales, would not alone suffice to
prove the derivation from the zoological legends of Aryan
mythology of the oral Turco-Finnic tradition, properly
speaking. We must, therefore, search for the proofs of
their influence in other quarters as well.</p>

<p>A Turanian story of the south of Siberia<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> combines
together several of the mythical subjects which we are
already acquainted with.</p>

<p>A poor old man and woman have three sons; the
three sons go upon the mountain to dream; the two
eldest dream of riches, and the third dreams that his
father and mother are lean camels, his brothers two
hungry wolves running towards the mountains, while he
himself, between the sun and the moon, wears the morning
star upon his forehead. The father orders the brothers
to kill him; they dare not do so; they only expel him
from the house, and kill the dog instead, the blood of
which they take to their father, who, thinking it is his
son's, says they have done well. The young man wanders
about till he comes to a hut where a lame old man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
a blind old woman are eating out of a golden cup, which
of itself fills with meat as they empty it (the moon).
The hungry youth helps himself to some of this meat,
but the old man finds, as he continues to eat the food,
that some one has put his teeth into it; with a hook,
which he whirls around him, he clutches hold of the young
man, who begs for his life, pledging himself to be the
eye of her who has no eyes, and the foot of him who has
no feet. This proposal pleases the old couple, and they
adopt him as their son; he makes himself a bow and a
wooden arrow, and goes to hunt wildfowl for their support.
The old man lends him his iron-grey horse, one
day old, but advises him to ride him only by day; the
young man, thinking that by night he conceals treasures,
cattle, and people, disobeys, and rides by night. What
the horse then does we shall see in the next chapter. The
youth fights and vanquishes the demon, by fastening one
of his lips to the heavens, and the other to the earth;
the defeated demon advises him to rub himself with the
fat of his stomach; inside his stomach he will find a
casket of silver, inside that a casket of gold, and inside
that another casket of silver; he is to take it and throw
it into the sea of milk. From the monster's stomach,
cut open, come forth innumerable animals, men, treasures,
and other objects. Some of the men say, "What noble
man has delivered us from the black night? what noble
man has shown us the clear day?" The youth finds in
the caskets money and a white handkerchief, which he
puts into his pocket; from the last casket come forth
more men, animals, and valuables of every kind; he
drives the white cattle before him and returns home,
where the old couple are asleep. He opens the handkerchief,
and finds in it the old woman's eyes; whilst he is
smoking near the fire, the old people waken, see him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
embrace him. The old man then endows him with the
power of transforming himself into a fox, a wolf, a lion,
a vulture, and other shapes, at will. He goes, to find for
himself a wife, to the residence of the prince Ai-Kan; the
latter promises to give his daughter to whoever will bring
him the necessary amount of gold. It is in the shape of
a vulture<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> that the young man sets out to search for it;
he then wins the young maiden who has the gold, and
she, who is herself the daughter of Ai-Kan, says to him,
"Thou art my husband." After various other transformations,
in one of which the two lean camels reappear,
<i>i.e.</i>, his two parents, of whom he had dreamt, whom he
loads with a sack, he ends by taking to himself another
wife, the daughter of Kün-Kan, and he lives now with one,
now with the other, to whom he gives the flesh of his own
infanticide father to eat. Let us recapitulate the moments
of this significant legend:&mdash;1st, We have the presage, the
dream of the mountain-peak; 2d, The three brothers, the
third of whom, predestined to good fortune, the others
wish to sacrifice; 3d, The lame and the blind in the
forest; 4th, The hero's hunt; 5th, The struggle with
the monster of night; 6th, The treasures, spiritual and
material, which come out of the monster; 7th, The cattle
in conjunction with the sea of milk; 8th, The passage of
the hero from the milky sea to the fireside, from the
alba to the aurora, from the whitish sky to the reddish
one; 9th, The awakening of the sleepers, and restoration
of sight to the blind, whilst he sits by the fire, whilst the
sun is united to the aurora; 10th, The transformation of
the hero himself; 11th, Winning his bride, by procuring
the necessary amount of gold; 12th, His marriage of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
wives; 13th, His revenge on his persecuting father. The
legend is in itself an epic poem, and we can only regret
that the Altaic story-tellers did not give it a more artistic
form than that in which it appears in the excellent collection
of Radloff.</p>

<p>Another interesting Turanian story, in the same collection,
which preserves several traces of the primitive myth,
is another version of the story of the hero who solves the
riddle proposed by his father-in-law, and thus wins his
wife. A father has three sons; the first-born dreams
that their cow has devoured a wolf; he goes to see, and
finds it is true (the aurora destroys the night). We have
already seen that, as the third brother is the wise child,
so the first-born of the three is often the one who possesses
the secret of solving riddles. The father of the three brothers
wishes to obtain a wife for his first-born son, and the
bride's father, to give her up, demands that the bridegroom's
father should come to take her, arriving, the
first time, with a fur-coat and without one (in the morning
the old man, by the advice of the eldest son, departs
wearing a coat of fur which seems to be one, but is not,
being in reality a coat of mail), and coming, the second
time, without touching the road, yet not off the road,
on horseback, yet without horses (the old man, by the
advice again of his first-born son, arrives at the father-in-law's
abode, going on the side of the road, and riding on
a stick; thus he obtains permission to take the bride
away for his son).</p>

<p>Professor Schiefner gives a Finnic variation of the
same story. A king orders the son of a peasant to come
neither by day nor by night, neither by the road nor by
the road-side, neither on horseback nor on foot, neither
dressed nor naked, neither inside nor outside. The intelligent
boy makes a robe of goat's skin, goes to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
city lying in the bottom of a coffin, during the morning
twilight, having a sieve fastened to one foot, and a brush
to the other, and stops on the doorstep of the antechamber,
with one leg out and the other in.</p>

<p>Such was the humour, and such the wisdom of our
fathers; ingenuity was measured by skill in solving
astronomical riddles. Now the riddles have taken another
form; they are strokes of diplomacy, amorous
hieroglyphs, ethical ambiguities, metaphysical nebulosities,
which we, the men of progress, must solve; but not
wishing to acknowledge our inferiority in acuteness to the
children of the legends, we are fain to persuade ourselves
that the new riddles are more obscure than the ancient.</p>

<p>In the Vedic riddles proposed to one another by the
aurora and the sun, we have seen how they were solved in
the morning by the nuptials of the guesser and the guessee.
Thus in the two riddles which we have just described,
the son of the old man and the child solve the riddle in
the morning. As to the sieve, the brush, and the coffin,
they are mythical furniture of great interest and obvious
import. The nocturnal sky is the great coffin; to sweep
the sky of night, we must have a brush; to sunder the
good grain from the bad during the night, as the cruel
mother-in-law commands, we must have a sieve; the
child-sun arrives, in the twilight, in the bottom of the
coffin, at the doorstep of the royal palace, and presents
to the maiden aurora (the Vedic cleaner or purifier) the
brush and the sieve. The sun, at twilight, is neither in
nor out. In the second Scottish story of Mr J. F.
Campbell, the giant commands the hero, among other
things, to cleanse, in one day, the stables which had not
been cleansed for seven years (Heraklés and Augeias).</p>

<p>But let us continue our subject, for the path is a long one.</p>

<p>A Mongol tradition, contained in the <i>Mongol Crestomathy</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of Papoff,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> speaks of the boy who comes riding
upon a black ox, instead of in a coffin.</p>

<p>We have seen above the cow who eats the wolf; in
another Altaic legend we find an old woman who gives
up her seven azure (dark-coloured) cows to be eaten by
the seven wolves, in order that the latter may spare the
child Kan Püdai, whom she had found at the foot of a
tree; meanwhile the child, who has fed upon two hundred
hares,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> has become strong, and breaks his iron cradle (the
iron sky of night is the cradle of the young sun); from
the horns of six roebucks he makes himself a bow; from
the skin of a colossal marine animal (the cloud, the
gloomy one), he makes a string for the bow (the string
of the Hindoo bow is also called <i>go</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, cow, as a
cloud in the sky, and as being formed from the hide
of a cow); he rides upon the azure calf (the dark
calf, which recalls our attention to the black ox, and
leads us to conclude the colossal animal to have been
a cow), and subdues and tames it; he then comes to
a field of snow, upon which he breathes a black and
numbing wind, and where he finds the seven wolves; he
ties them to the tail of his calf, and drags them along
the ground till they die. The boy continues his wild
beast hunt; he kills the black and fat ones, and leaves
the yellow and lean ones alone. He goes into a black
sea, and erects there a black castle, into which he receives
both the old woman who had sustained him, and his
azure (<i>i.e.</i>, dark-coloured) calf. Thereafter the young
Kan Püdai, applying himself to warfare, forsakes or
exchanges his calf for a horse. We shall see in the next
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>chapter what he does with his horse;&mdash;suffice it to notice
here, that, in the end, he meets the black bull, who will
one day be the king of the Altaï. The soul of the black
bull takes refuge in a red thread in the middle of the
rainbow (in the popular belief of the East the rainbow
was supposed to be a bridge, a road traversed by the souls
of mortals); the young Kan Püdai transfixes it with his
arrows. He wins the white cattle, kills the monstrous
Kara Kula, and, taking the latter's wife and daughter
with him, returns home; and for seven days there is eating,
drinking, and festivity in the house of Kan Püdai.
But up to this point it is not said that he has espoused
the daughter and the wife of Kara Kula. Kan Püdai is,
on the contrary, passionately enamoured of Tämän Ökö,
the daughter of the sky (duhitar divas, or daughter of the
sky, is the name usually given to the aurora in the Vedic
hymns), and ascends, in order to secure her and make her
his wife, to the third heaven (it is the third step of
Vish&#7751;us; it is the third brother, the sun of the third
night-watch, who carries off the palm against the gloomy
monster). In order to become worthy of the daughter of
the sky, Kan Püdai has to kill two monsters; to scatter
ashes on the field of victory, and lead away from it the
white cattle; to catch the three bears; to take the three
black bulls and make them swallow three hills; to take
the tiger and give it the grass of the three mountains to
eat; to kill the whale in the azure sea (all different forms
of one and the same mythical and heroic battle); and,
finally, to play upon the mountain-peak with the golden-haired
monster Andalma. He then obtains his bride, and
returns with her to his own country, where he hunts, and
makes war, and vanquishes all his enemies, until he grows
old; he then renounces all except his old companion (the
old sun and the old aurora meet again in the evening).</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Here evidently the mythology is really zoological.</p>

<p>In the complicated legend of Ai-Kan, we have in the
brother Altyn Ayak, who sleeps in the form of a golden
cup, and who awakens to help Ai-Kan, a figure which,
though not the same as, is similar to, that of the sleeping
brother Kumbhakar&#7751;as (conch-ear) in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,
who awakens to help Râva&#7751;as. We have the inebriating
liquor which gives strength to the hero, who is resuscitated
three times from death, after having been the food
of dogs; the wolves who devour Sary-Kan, or the fair-haired
prince; the hero (the sun) who beats the wife
(the aurora) given him by the two brothers (the Açvinâu);
the friendly dog and cat; the golden cup in which the
brother of Ai-Kan is shut up asleep, and which falls
into the sea; the grateful animals which search for
the cup; the gem found in the stomach of a fish (from
the whale of the nocturnal ocean the gem comes forth);
and the consequent awakening of the sleeping Altyn
Ayak.</p>

<p>The following is from an Altaic saga, in the collection
of Radloff:&mdash;Beyond the sea, on a rock surrounded with
treasures, a dwarf girl is brought up, against whom
aggressive warriors can prevail nothing. She sends all
enemies away, after loading them with gold and silver,
and placing on their heads part of the hair of her forehead,
which proves to be sufficient to cover seven men.
In this marvellous hair, in this enchanted maiden, and in
the warriors who come by sea, who does not recognise
the veil of the maiden aurora of the Vedâs, who uncovers
her bosom before the sun her husband, and the sea which
the warrior-sun crosses, and from which he emerges to
come to the aurora?&mdash;who does not recognise the golden
fleece, Jason, Medea, the Argonauts of Hellenic tradition?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Finnic mythology of the <i>Kalevala</i><a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> also, we
have upon the mountain a good and pure hostess, a
generous giver, from the golden windows of whose house
are observed the women who give the wildfowl; but in
this Finnic representation, it is not the heroic girl-aurora,
it seems to me, we recognise, but the moon, Diana the
huntress (the German <i>Helljäger</i>), who also appears on the
mountain-peak, surrounded by the stars of the nocturnal
forest, where the wildfowl is found, which she can therefore
lavish upon the hero.</p>

<p>The Finns worship a thundering god, united with the
clouds, who has the thunderbolt for his sword, and who
is called Ukko,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> father of Väinämöinen, the valorous and
wise hero, who speaks in the womb of his mother, who
performs prodigies when yet a child, and who produces
the sun and the moon.</p>

<p>This child-hero occurs again in their dwarf-god (<i>pikku
mies</i>), who, although, like the Hindoo Vish&#7751;us, he is but
a span long, wields in his hand an axe the length of a
man, with which he cuts down an oak-tree that no one
had yet been able to bring to the ground. The sun-hero
is little; but his ray, his thunderbolt, his weapon,
his hand, lengthen themselves, extend themselves as far
as the dwarf-hero can desire, in order to destroy the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>enemy, who wears here the well-known aspect of the
trunk of a tree, or of a dark forest. The woodcutter is
therefore a favourite figure in popular tradition. And
the fact that Väinämöinen, having grown old and truthful
in speech, cuts down in the <i>Kalevala</i>,<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> by the help of
the little god, the prodigious oak, shows us that this little
god is a new and junior form, a younger and victorious
brother, or self-reproduction of the erewhile child-hero
Väinämöinen, who has lived his life of a day. The
valiant child-sun of morning has become the experienced
old sun of evening; but as this old sun is not strong
enough to cut down the oak-tree, under whose shadow
he loses himself, he is obliged to become a child again to
develope the requisite amount of strength; he needs a
younger brother, a hero or dwarf-god, to free him from
the evil shades of the forest of night. To this end he
also invokes the sun and the moon to illumine the forest,
and also the bear (the middle brother)&mdash;(in the <i>Kalevala</i>,
of the three heroes it is the bear Ilmarinen who shows
the greatest strength, and who wins the virgin for his
bride)&mdash;in order that by his strength he may root up the
tree. But to root up the tree is all that bears can do, while
Väinämöinen wishes it to be cut down; and so this victorious
enterprise is intrusted to the dwarf-god. Thus,
without explicit mention of their names, we find the
three brothers described in the entirely mythical epopee
of the Finns.</p>

<p>Alongside of the dwarf, by force of antithesis, there
arises, even in the Finnic mythology, the idea of a giant,
a Titan who amuses himself with uplifting and hurling
rocks and mountains. The cloud, the monster of darkness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
being represented as a mountain, the monster
inhabiting this country must fight by means of the
mountain itself. The cloudy mountain moves; it is a
giant monster that moves it; it is the second brother, the
strong brother, the son of the cow, the bear, who amuses
himself with it, who shakes, carries, and throws it like a
weapon. And such mythical battles must have seemed
so much the more natural in the age in which the greater
number of the myths were conceived and produced, as we
know it to have been the age which archæologists call
the age of stone. The sun, as a dwarf, destroys the vast
cloud, the vast darkness, viewed as a giant.</p>

<p>But battles are not always going on in the heavens;
even the wild animals of the gloomy forest become tame
and rest themselves; music fills the soul with calm sentiments.
Therefore even the warrior Gandharvâs of the
Hindoo Olympus are transformed into expert musicians,
who entrance the very gods with wonder. The song of
the Sirens attracts and seduces the traveller; the lyre of
Orpheus draws after it mountains, trees, and animals;
the harp of Väinämöinen, in the <i>Kalevala</i>, makes the wolf
forget his ferocity, the bear his wildness, the fish his coldness.
And it is grief which is the first inspirer of song;
the first stanza of the poet Vâlmîkis had its origin in
the sorrow he felt upon seeing a bird bereft of its companion.
Orpheus (the Thracian sun) sings and plays for
grief, when the serpent (the shade of night) has bitten
and thrown into the gloomy regions his sweet bride
Eurydice (the aurora), and moves the demons to pity;
the harp of Väinämöinen is also born of sorrow.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
The epopee of the Finns contains, moreover, several
other myths cognate with those of Aryan mythical tradition;&mdash;such
as the resuscitated hero; the winning of the
maiden by display of heroism; the bride heroically won
and afterwards cut in pieces; the cup of abundance, or
the cornucopia (the Sampo); the golden cradle; the
marvellous vessel in which the hero crosses the sea; the
three sisters, of whom one gives black milk, one white,
and one red (night, the alba or moon, and aurora); the
invulnerable shirt; the magician who makes children of
gold and silver; and others of secondary importance,<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
but all tending to prove that formerly the Turanian and
Aryan races, in their neighbouring abodes, were originally
much more similar to each other than they now appear,
on account of partly diversity of language, and partly
their different degrees of civilisation.</p>

<p>I have just named the Finnish Sampo as a cup of
abundance or cornucopia; it does, in fact, yield marvellous
abundance to whoever possesses it, and wherever it
falls. It is made of the feather of a swan, or of a duck
(the swan and the duck are, as we shall see, confounded
together in tradition, and the duck, like the hen, is a
symbol of abundance), of a tuft of wool, of a grain of
corn, and of chips from a spindle, all evident symbols of
abundance; and it becomes so large that it has to be
carried by a hundred-horned ox (reminding us of the
horns of the cow which spin). The ox bears abundance
upon its horns, it yields abundance from its horns. The
cornucopia is, in my mind, unmistakably implied in these
mythical data.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
The same mythical correspondence which we have
found to exist between the Finnic epos and the various
legendary Aryan traditions is observable between the
latter and the Esthonian popular tales. In the collection
of Frederic Kreuzwald<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> we find numerous proofs of this
correspondence.</p>

<p>In the first story we have, in a hut in the forest, three
sisters, of whom the youngest is the most beautiful. The
old witch, her step-mother, persecutes her, and always
gives her filaments of gold to spin, hiding from time to
time the gold she has spun in a secret room. During the
summer the old woman goes out of the house, no one
knows where, after having apportioned their respective
tasks to the three sisters. While the old woman is out,
a young prince, having lost himself in the forest, finds
his way to the hut, and becomes enamoured of the
youngest of the three sisters. The young couple speak
to each other of love in the light of the moon and of the
stars; while the old king, impatient at the absence of
his son, falls into grief, and sends everywhere to look for
him. After three days he is found; before going back
to the palace, he secretly promises to the youngest sister
that he will return. Meanwhile the old woman comes
back, finds the work badly done, curses, threatens, and
maltreats the girl. Early in the morning, while the old
woman and the two elder sisters are slumbering, the
maiden slips out, and leaves the house. During her
childhood she had learned the language of birds; accordingly,
when she meets a crow, she salutes him by the
name of "bird of light," and sends him as a messenger
to the young prince, to warn him not to come back to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
her, on account of the fury of the old woman. The
prince then names her another trysting-place, and the
young couple meet under a tree, between the second and
third crowing of the cock; and when the sun rises, they
flee away together. The old witch causes them to be followed
by a ball made of nine evil herbs, and carried by
malignant winds. The fugitives are overtaken on the
banks of a river, where the ball strikes the prince's horse;
it rears up on its hind legs, and the girl falls off into the
river, into the hands of a marine monster; upon which
the prince is struck by a disease which no one can cure.
By eating the flesh of a hog, the prince acquires a knowledge
of the language of birds; he sends the swallows as
messengers to the magician of Finland, that he may teach
him the way to free a girl who has been transformed into
a pond-rose (lotus-flower). The answer, instead of being
brought by the swallows, is brought by an eagle. The
prince must become a shrimp, in order to enter the water
without being drowned; he must detach the lotus by its
root, draw it along the surface of the water to the bank,
near a stone, and pronounce these words, "From the
pond-rose, a maiden&mdash;from the shrimp, a man." The
crow confirms the eagle's words. The prince hears a
song issue from the rose; he then determines to deliver
the girl. The two young people emerge together from
the water. The maiden is ashamed of being naked, and
the prince goes to procure nuptial robes for her; after
which he conducts her to the palace in a beautiful chariot,
where a joyous and gorgeous wedding-festival is celebrated.
Soon afterwards the old witch dies, to appear
again in the form of a cat, which is taken by the tail and
flung into the fire. In the witch's house are found mountains
of spun gold, which serve for the dowry of the
three sisters. We have already said that the three sisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
correspond to the three brothers, and the youngest sister
to the youngest brother. The epithet of <i>young</i> is often
given to the Vedic aurora, whom the sun marries. Here
the prince marries the youngest of the three sisters; the
morning aurora is united to the sun. Towards night she
falls into the water; it is the witch (night) who throws
her in; the hog which the prince (the sun) eats we shall
see to be a figurative representation of the nocturnal
monster, or the moon. Eating the hog, staying in the
forest of night, the prince learns the language of birds.
The prince frees the maiden from the waters; the sun
delivers the aurora from the gloomy ocean of night, and
robes her in his splendour, causing the witch of night to
be burned in the flames of the aurora, and taking from
the witch's abode the spun gold or golden fleece.</p>

<p>In the third Esthonian story, a woman, called mother-of-gold,
bears, by the favour of a dwarf, three dwarf-sons
at the same time, who become three heroes. The first is
the seer (the wise brother), the second has a ready arm
(the strong brother), the third runs swiftly in the race
(a quality distinctive of the third brother, Ar&#501;unas, in
the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, and which is applicable to the victorious
sun of morning, who wins the race, together with
the aurora).</p>

<p>A variation of the story relating to the youngest sister
and the dwarf is that of the girl seven years old, the wise
girl (the aurora), in the fourth Esthonian tale, who, being
persecuted by her step-mother, retires into the forest (the
night). While there, it seems to her that she is in
heaven, where, in a house of crystal and pearls, she is
received by a well-dressed woman of gold (the fair-haired
moon). The girl asks the golden woman to be allowed
to take care of the cattle, like the cowmaid aurora. In
the history of <i>Ardshi Bordshi</i> we have seen the wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
puppet. This form of the wise girl, the dressed girl of
wood, occurs again in the Esthonian story; in which
she is made of wood from the forest, of three anchovies,
of bread, of a black serpent, and of the blood of the girl
herself, to whom the image has a great likeness, and
which may be beaten by the old step-mother without being
hurt. From the forest-tree, wood, or wooden box of the
night, with the juice of the black serpent of night and
the blood of the girl aurora of evening, comes forth the
maiden aurora of morning, the wise, the speaking puppet,
the puppet who guesses the riddles. The girl who comes
out of wood is represented as a wooden puppet; more
frequently the puppet is the moon, the wise fairy who
comes out of the forest. In the same story we have the
magic rod which produces a cock upon the mountain,
beside which a tablecloth spreads itself out, while the
chairs range themselves in their places, and the dishes
are filled of their own accord. The story ends with the
usual marriage between the beautiful maiden, and a king's
son returning from the chase (or the son who comes out
of the forest of night, viewed as infested by ferocious
animals).</p>

<p>In the sixth Esthonian tale, the poor girl finds a
woman in a white robe (the moon), adorned with gold,
upon a rock near a fountain, who announces her approaching
marriage with a youth as poor as herself;
but the good fairy godmother&mdash;for in the legends the
godmother is represented as good, as the stepmother is
wicked&mdash;promises to make them both rich and happy.
She calls herself the lady of the waters, secret wife
of the wind, and she judges the criminals who present
themselves at her tribunal (Proserpina or Persephonê).</p>

<p>In the seventh tale, a boy nine years of age, the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
son of two poor people, goes out to be a cowherd; his
master treats him well, but his mistress gives him more
floggings than bread. One day the young cowherd is
unfortunate enough to lose a cow; he searches for it all
through the forest, but in vain. He re-enters the house
with the cattle, after the sun has set some time. The
observant eye of his mistress perceives at once that there
is a cow missing; she beats the boy without pity, and
sends him out to look for it, threatening to kill him if he
returns without it. He wanders through the forest; but
when the sun arises from out the bosom of the dawn, he
resolves to stay out of the house, and not to return to his
persecutor (the young morning sun flees from the old
and perverse night). In the evening, the boy finds an
old dwarf, who is his host during the night (the moon),
and who says to him, "When the sun rises to-morrow,
carefully observe the spot in which he rises. Thou must
go in that direction, so that every morning thou may'st
have the sun before thee, and every evening the sun
behind thee. Thus thy strength will increase more and
more every day." How can one indicate better the
apparent course of the solar hero, or of the sun in the
night? The hero, in order to go towards the morning
sun, must necessarily have the sun of evening behind
him. The old dwarf also gives him a sack and a little
barrel, in which he will always find the food and drink
he requires; but he recommends him never to eat or
drink more than is necessary, that he may have to give
to a hungry bird or a thirsty wild beast. He also leaves
him a rolled-up leaf of burdock, upon which, by rolling
it out, he will always be able to cross water (a new form
of the cup). We know how the Hindoos represented
their god as floating upon a lotus-leaf in the midst of the
waters, and how Padma&#501;as (born of the lotus-flower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
or the rose of the waters, which shuts during the night)
was one of the names of Brâhman; here we have the god
or hero shutting himself up in the flower, from which he
afterwards comes out. In the chapters on the Serpent
and the Frog we shall again see how the god sometimes
shuts himself up in a monstrous form in this flower, the
rose, on account of a curse from which he is to be freed
by a beautiful maiden. We have seen how the Esthonian
girl, who was by the curse of the old woman thrown into
the water, was transformed into a water-rose or lotus-flower,
and delivered by the young prince. The Esthonian
boy finds himself before a small lake; he throws
the leaf in, and it becomes a magical boat, which carries
him over. Meanwhile he has become strong. Upon
the mountain he sees a serpent, a tortoise, and an
eagle, all three of enormous dimensions, approaching to
attack him, with a man upon a black horse, which has
wings on its feet, in the rear of them. He kills the
serpent and the tortoise, but the eagle flies away. The
man with the black horse takes the boy into his house,
and appoints him to look after the dogs, that they may
not get loose from their chains, a danger against which
the man provides by making twelve colossal oxen fetch
rocks upon rocks, to repair the damage done by the dogs.
The rocks, touched by a magical rod, arrange themselves
upon the car drawn by the oxen. At last, by
the advice of the eagle, he steals his master's horse,
and departs to sojourn among mankind, taking a wife
with him.</p>

<p>In the eighth Esthonian story too, the third brother is
the cunning one. His two elder brothers, after the death
of their father, despoil him of his share of the inheritance,
and he is reduced to wander alone and impoverished
about the world in quest of good fortune. He falls in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
with a woman who complains to him that her husband
regularly beats her when she is unable to procure for him
the things he wants, which he asks for in the form of a
riddle. The third brother solves the enigma for the
woman (the moon), who, in gratitude, gives him provisions
for his travels. He then comes to a palace, where
the king is engaged in celebrating a summer festival, and
he undertakes to provide and prepare the feast. A
magician presents himself at the festival in the shape of
an old man, and asks to taste the food. The young man
suspects him, but, seeing a ring upon his finger, he consents
to allow him if he gives him a pledge. The magician
vows that he has nothing to give. The youth asks
for his ring, and the old man in his gluttony at once
gives it up; upon which the youth, who, along with the
ring, has taken all the magician's strength away, first
binds and derides him, and then has him beaten by seven
strong men. The old man breaks the ropes and disappears;
however, the young man, having the ring in his
hands, possesses the means of tracking his footsteps and
making him his. (This is the usual disc, lasso, or bridle
which is now in the hands of the hero, now in those of
the monster.) The youth follows the magician underground.
The latter, it appears, is served by three maidens,
who, when they perceive that the sorcerer has lost his
ring, and that they have a young man for companion,
enjoy themselves with him while the magician is asleep.
The youth learns from them that the old wizard also
possesses a sword which can destroy armies, and a
magical rod which can create a bridge to span the sea;
these, therefore, he steals, and departs, returning by a
wonderful bridge thrown over the sea to the palace
whence he had started. It seems to him as if his journey
had lasted only two nights, instead of which a year has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
passed.<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> He finds on his arrival his two brothers in the
king's service, one as coachman and the other as a valet,
both enriched because they have received the pay due to
their younger brother for having prepared the great feast.
The young man now engages himself in another capacity,
in a species of service especially dear to the young hero,
next to those of stable-boy and cowherd; that is to say, he
becomes under-cook of the king. (In the <i>Vîrâ&#7789;a-Parvam</i>
of the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, it is the second of the brothers
who disguises himself as a cook, in order to prepare good
sauces and substantial food for the king whose guest he
is; the elder brother is disguised as a Brâhmanas, a wise
adviser; the third brother, Ar&#501;unas, the agile, the swift
one, pretends to be a eunuch, is given in exchange for a
woman, and teaches dancing, music, and singing in the
gynecium. Of the two sons of the Açvinâu, one becomes
a groom, the other a cowherd.) His brothers continue to
dislike him, and because he boasts to them that he had
seen in hell golden birds, they induce the king to send
him to hell in order to procure them. He accomplishes
this undertaking with great difficulty, and brings the
birds in a sack made of spiders' webs, which is so strong
that the birds enclosed in it cannot extricate themselves.
In the same sack, during another expedition, the young
man brings from hell many precious objects of gold and
silver. In compensation, he only asks of the king to
send the princess, his daughter, to listen for one evening
to the conversation of his two brothers the coachman and
the valet. Both boast of having enjoyed to satiety the
favours of the princess. The latter, indignant and full
of shame, runs to tell the king everything, upon which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
he arraigns them before him and has them judged. The
third brother is named Counsellor; with his enchanted
sword he destroys an entire army of enemies, and obtains
in reward for his services and his valour the king's
daughter to wife.</p>

<p>The ninth Esthonian story presents to us the son of
the thunder, who sells his soul to the devil, on condition
that the latter serves him for seven years. The time
agreed upon is nearly come to an end, and the son of the
thunder wishes to escape from him, and profits by an
opportunity which has chanced. The devil sees a black
cloud, which is a sign of an approaching tempest; he is
afraid, hides himself under a stone, and asks the son of
the thunder to keep him company. The latter consents;
but seeing that the devil is afraid, at each thunderclap
he presses his ears and eyes in such a manner as to make
him perspire and shiver all over. The devil, believing
this to be the effect of the thunder, promises the son of
the thunder that he will not only leave him his soul, but
give him three other souls, if he will deliver him from
the evils which he suffers on account of the thunder, by
taking from the thundering god, the father of the clouds,
his weapon (which is also a musical instrument). This
weapon, having been ravished from the god, is taken by
the devil into hell, into a chamber of iron, shut up
within seven castles. A great drought coming upon the
earth, the son of the thunder repents of having rendered
such a service to the devil; he finds means, however, of
informing the thunder-god where his weapon is concealed.
The thunder-god then becomes a child, and
engages himself in the service of a fisherman, near a lake
which the devil is accustomed to visit to steal the fishes.
He surprises him in the act of robbery, and by the help
of a magician takes him prisoner, and has him beaten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
without pity, until he promises to pay a heavy ransom
in money to be let free, the fisherman and his child to
accompany him to hell itself to receive the sum of
money. Arrived in hell, the devil entertains them like a
gentleman. The child tells the fisherman to ask the
devil to show them the musical instrument which he
keeps enclosed in the iron room. The devil kindly consents,
but cannot draw from the instrument anything
more musical than the mewing of a cat or the grunting
of a pig. The fisherman then laughs at the devil, and
says that his boy can play better. The devil does not
believe it, and laughingly gives the instrument, which
he calls bagpipes, to the boy. The latter blows into
them and makes such a noise that all hell resounds with
it, and the devils fall to the earth as if dead. The child
then becomes the god of thunder again, and returns to
heaven, where by the noise of his instrument he opens
the celestial reservoirs and lets out the beneficent rain.
The description of the tempest which occurs in many
Vedic hymns is the germ of this interesting myth. The
drum or kettledrum thunder is a familiar image in
Hindoo poetry, and the Gandharvâs, the musician-warriors
of the Hindoo Olympus, have no other instrument
than the thunder. The conch of the warrior
Pâ&#7751;&#7693;avâs in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, and the famous horn of
Orlando (which comes from the golden horn of Odin),
are epical reminiscences of thunder. Orpheus, who in
hell plays on his lyre and tames the animals, is a more
lucid and more perfect form of this Esthonian thunder-god
who plays the bagpipes in hell. It is also remarkable
how, in harmony with the pastoral bagpipes, in the
tenth Esthonian story, which is a variation of the preceding
one, the god transformed into a powerful boy is
called a little shepherd or cowherd&mdash;another interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
fact, which completes his identification with Orpheus.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
The magic flute is a variation of the same celestial
musical instrument. The magic flute, the bagpipes or
wonderful pipe, occurs again in the twenty-third
Esthonian story, in which the good Tiidu, by means of
it and of his virtue, obtains riches. The magical harp
of Gunnar in the Edda has the same marvellous effects.</p>

<p>Evidently the monster-dwarf is a favourite subject of
Esthonian tradition, and it often occurs in the Hindoo
and in the German traditions, as well as in the Franco-Latin
tradition of Charlemagne. The eleventh story
introduces us to three dwarf-brothers who contend for
the inheritance left by their father, consisting of a
miraculous hat, which enables its wearer to see everything,
whilst he can himself be visible or invisible at
pleasure (this hat is made of pieces of men's nails cut
up);<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> of a pair of slippers which transport the owner in
an instant wherever he wishes (we must not forget that
Cinderella, when she loses the slipper, is overtaken by
the prince bridegroom); and of a stick which strikes of
itself, and destroys everything, even stronger than the
thunderbolt (the thunderbolt itself). The three brothers
maintain that these three articles, to be really useful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>must be the property of one; but who is to enjoy this
privilege? A man comes up to put an end to the dispute,
and feigns disbelief in the virtue of these three
things, unless he proves it himself. The three simpletons
give them to him that he may prove them. The man
takes them off, and the three dwarfs are left to meditate
upon the truth of the above-quoted proverb, "Between
two disputers the third profits," or at least that variation
of it which their own case suggests "Between three
that dispute, the fourth profits."</p>

<p>In the thirteenth Esthonian story, the privileged
character of the third brother is explained, as we are
told that he is the son of a king, but was exchanged by
a witch during his infancy for the child of a peasant.
The latter died in the palace, whilst the king's son grew
in the hut, showing in every action his royal pedigree.
Here we have the story of the hero who is exposed on
the mountains intimately connected with that of the
third brother. To this third brother, who alone shows
himself to be devoted to his father, and who alone makes
a vow to watch by his grave, is also attributed the merit
of having delivered, upon a high mountain of crystal,
from a seven years' sleep, a princess, who then becomes
his wife. We have seen the aurora-awakener in the
Vedic hymns&mdash;the sun and the aurora arouse each other:
the sun sends forth the aurora; the aurora draws out
the sun. The myth reproduces itself every day, and
expresses in its entirety a daily phenomenon of light in
the heavens. In Northern countries, where the contrast
is great between winter and spring, and therefore the
impression is striking which is caused by the cessation
of vegetation in autumn, the earth also assumed the
aspect of a dead young princess; but an omniscient
magician having said, <i>Non est mortua puella, sed dormit</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the third brother, predestined to the enterprise, lays
down his poor robes, and dresses himself, on the first occasion,
in the colour of bronze; on the second, the colour of
silver; on the third, the colour of gold, and ascends the
mountain of crystal, or ice, whence he brings forth the
beautiful spring. The sky, grey in autumn, snowy in
winter, and golden in spring, corresponds to the grey
sky of evening, the silver one of night, and the golden
one of morning. Spring is the dawn of the year; the
primitive myth is but amplified; the last hour of the
day awakens the aurora; the last month of the solar
year awakens the spring. The application of the myth
of the day to the year is one of the greatest simplicity.</p>

<p>In the fourteenth story, the king of the golden country
loses himself in the forest full of ferocious animals, and
cannot find his way out. A stranger (no doubt the
devil) conducts him out, on condition that he will give
him whatever first comes to meet him. The king promises.
The first thing he sees on his return is his royal
child, who, carried by his nurse, stretches out his arms to
his father. The king exchanges him for a peasant's girl,
whom he gives up to the stranger, allowing his own son
to be brought up among the peasant's herds. The king's
son, having grown to manhood, determines to go and deliver
the poor girl. He disguises himself as a poor man,
puts a sack of peas on his shoulders, and goes into the
forest where his father was lost eighteen years before.
He also loses himself, and meets the stranger, who promises
to direct him if he will give him the peas which
are in the sack, as they will serve, he alleges, to recompense
the assistants at the funeral of his aunt, who died
in poverty during the night.&mdash;This pulse in funeral
ceremonies refers to a very ancient custom. The Vedic
ceremonials already mention them in connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
funerals; and in the Greek belief, the dead carried
vegetables with them to hell, either for the right of
passage or as provisions for travelling. In Piedmont, it
is still the custom on the second of November (All Soul's
Day) to make a great distribution of kidney-beans to the
poor, who pray for the souls of the dead. Vegetables,
peas, vetches, and kidney-beans are symbols of abundance,
and to this belief may be traced the numerous Indo-European
stories in which mention is made of beans
which multiply themselves in the pipkin, or of peas which
grow up to the sky, and up the stalk of which the hero
climbs to heaven. The vegetables necessary for being introduced
into the kingdom of the dead, and the pea by
means of which the hero enters heaven, are variations of
the same mythical subject. In Hindoo tradition, besides
the pea or kidney-bean, we have the pumpkin as a
symbol of abundance, which is multiplied infinitely, or
which mounts up to heaven. The wife of the hero
Sagaras gives birth to a pumpkin, from which afterwards
come forth sixty thousand sons. The kidney-bean, the
pea, the vetch, the common bean, and the pumpkin are
also symbols of generation, not only on account of the
facility with which they multiply, but also on account of
their form. We have seen in the Vedic ceremonials what
organs are represented by the two kidney-beans; we shall
also see, in the chapter on the Ass, how the names given
to the organs of generation are also used to designate
fools. Now, it is worthy of notice that the Sanskrit word
<i>mâshas</i> (or kidney-bean) also signified the foolish, the
stolid one, in the same way as in Piedmont a <i>bonus vir</i>
is called a kidney-bean. Thus, too, the pumpkin, which
expresses fecundity, also means, in Italian, idiocy or
stupidity. As to beans, I have already remarked, in my
work upon "Nuptial Usages," upon their symbolical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
meaning, and cited the Russian and Piedmontese custom
of putting a black and a white bean into the cake eaten
at Epiphany, one of which represents the male and the
other the female, one the king and the other the queen.
The two who find the beans kiss each other with joyful
auguries. As all these vegetables personify the moon,
which we know to be considered as a giver of abundance,
and which, by its form of a turning ball, can well be represented
by the turning pea, in this personification we
must search for the solution of the principal myths relating
to vegetables.&mdash;The young prince of the Esthonian
story, having obtained the stranger's favour in the gloomy
forest by means of the peas, engages himself in his
service, with intent to deliver the girl who had freed him
by taking his place with the stranger during eighteen
years. He therefore follows him; but on the way he
lets a pea fall to the ground from time to time, in order
to know the way back. He is conducted by a strange
and wild subterranean passage, where silence as of the
tomb reigns&mdash;it is, in fact, the kingdom of the dead&mdash;where
birds have the appearance of wishing to sing, dogs
to bark, and oxen to low, but cannot, and where the
water flows without a murmur. The young prince feels
in his heart a kind of anguish; the universal stillness in
the midst of animated beings oppresses him. Having
passed the region of silence, they come to that of deafening
noise. The young prince thinks he hears the excruciating
din of twenty-four saws at work; but the old
stranger tells him that it is only his grandmother who
has fallen asleep, and is snoring. At last they come to
the stranger's dwelling, where the prince finds the beautiful
maiden, but the old stranger will not let him speak.
He sees in the stable a white horse and a black cow,
with a white or luminous-headed calf. This cow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
young prince is ordered to milk until there is not a drop
of milk in its breast; instead of milking it with his
fingers, he, by the advice of the girl, uses for that purpose
red-hot pincers. Another time the youth is told to
lead away the enchanted calf with the white or luminous
head. In order that it may not escape, the girl gives
him a magic thread, of which one end is to be tied to the
left leg of the calf, and the other to the little toe of the
prince's left foot.&mdash;The little finger, although the smallest,
is the most privileged of the five. It is the one that
knows everything; and in Piedmont, when the mothers
wish to make their children believe that they are in communication
with a mysterious spy, who sees everything
that they do, they are accustomed to awe them by the
words, "My little finger tells me everything."&mdash;At last
the two young people resolve to flee. Before starting,
the prince splits open the forehead of the white-headed
calf; from its skull comes forth an enchanted little red
ball, which shines like a small sun. He wraps it up,
leaving part of it uncovered to light the way, and flees
away with the girl. Being followed by malignant spirits,
who are sent by the old man to follow them, the two
fugitives, by means of the enchanted little ball (or pearl),
turned round three times, become, first the one a pond
and the other a fish, then the one a rose-bush and the other
a rose, then again the one a breeze and the other a gnat,
until the stone which covers the entrance to the subterranean
world having been lifted up, they arrive again
safe and happy upon the earth; and by means of the little
red ball, they show themselves to mankind in splendid
and princely robes. I scarcely think it necessary to explain
to the reader the sense of this lucid mythical story.
The black cow which produces the calf with the white or
luminous head is a Vedic antithesis which we have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
seen;<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> the cow (night) produces the calf (the moon).
The prince takes the little red ball out of the calf; by
means of this ball, the girl is delivered from the regions
of gloom. The little ball moves the stone; the sun and
the aurora come out together from the mountain, after
having travelled together in the kingdom of shadows;
the sun delivers the aurora. This story unites together
and puts in order several myths of an analogous character,
but born separately.</p>

<p>The three next stories describe other voyages made by
the solar hero to heaven, or in hell, and end by meaning
the same thing. In the eighteenth story we again
find the enchanted ring, called Solomon's ring, which the
young hero goes to search for; when he finds it, by
taking it from the daughter of hell, and puts it on his
finger, he is of a sudden endowed with such strength
that he can split a rock with one blow of his fist. The
little red ball of the story just described, which lifts up
the rock, and this ring which splits the stone, represent
the same mythical object, <i>i.e.</i>, the sun, the sun's ball or
disc.</p>

<p>The twenty-first story shows us the fearless hero who
frees a castle from the presence of the demons, and who
thus gains a treasure; riches are the reward of valour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
The twentieth Esthonian story is a variation of the
exceedingly popular tale of Blue Beard, the killer of his
wives. The Esthonian monster-husband has already
killed eleven, and is about to murder the twelfth, by way
of punishing her for having, against his express prohibition,
visited the secret room opened by the golden key
(perhaps the moon), when a youth who takes care of the
goslings, the friend of her childhood, comes to deliver
her. From the subject itself, and the expressions used
in this story, we can discover the origin of the terrible
charivari in the nuptials of widowers or widows. This
savage custom is intended not only to deride the lust
of the old man or woman who marries again, but to
warn the girl who marries the one, or the youth who
marries the other, of the possibility of a fate similar to
the first wife or husband. When, therefore, the wife
<i>apatighnî</i> (who does not kill her husband) is praised to
the Vedic husband, we must understand that the <i>patighnî</i>
(or killer of her husband) is a widow, whom no one must
marry, as being suspected of murder. Hence, to free
herself from this suspicion, an honest Hindoo wife (like
Gudrun in the Edda) was to throw herself into the fire
after the death of her husband; the evening aurora, after
the death of the sun, dies too.</p>

<p>In the twenty-second story we have once more the
myth of the young pastoral hero; he is the son of a king.
By the order of his step-mother, a witch, who carries off
shepherds, steals him from the palace during his infancy,
and abandons him in a solitary place, where he is brought
up by cowherds, and becomes himself an excellent cowherd.
An old man finds him and says, looking at him
and at the cattle, "Thou dost not seem to me born to
remain a cowherd." The boy answers that he knows he
was born to command, and adds, "Here I learn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
duties of a commander by anticipation. If things go
well with the quadrupeds, I shall also prosper with
bipeds." The shepherd is therefore a little king; a good
shepherd will become a good king. The boy goes through
several adventures, in which he displays his valour. A
wicked German lady wishes to take from him the
strawberries which he has plucked. He defends himself
bravely; his mistress persecutes him; and he takes twelve
wolves, shuts them up in a cavern, and each day gives
them a lamb to eat, in order to avenge himself upon his
wicked mistress, to whom he simply says that the wolves
have devoured them. At last he causes her to be devoured
herself by the wolves, who eat her all up, leaving only
the heart (the sun) and the tongue, which are too full of
venom for the wolves of the night, because they burn
their mouths. At the age of eighteen, the youth has
several other adventures. He becomes enamoured of a
gardener's daughter, and is found again by the king his
father, who, before allowing him to marry the beautiful
gardener's daughter, wishes to prove that they are predestined
to each other. He cuts a ring in two with his
sword, and gives one part to the young prince and the
other to the maiden; the two halves must be preserved
by both, and one day they will meet of themselves and
form again the whole ring, in such a manner that it will
be impossible to find the place where it was broken.&mdash;In
a Tuscan story, the beautiful maiden gives half her necklace
to the third brother. The young couple lose each
other; their meeting again and mutual recognition take
place when the two parts of the necklace join each other.
The use of the wedding-ring has a mythical origin. The
solar (and sometimes the lunar disc) is the ring which
unites the heavenly husband and wife.&mdash;When, after
other adventures, the two young people of the Esthonian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
story join together the two halves of their ring, their
misfortunes come to an end; they marry and live together
happily, whilst the cruel step-mother, who meanwhile
has become a widow, is expelled from the kingdom.</p>

<p>The last Esthonian story tells of the extraordinary
births, in the same day, of a handsome prince and a
beautiful princess. The princess is born in a bird's egg,
laid like a pearl in the bosom of the queen; she has at
first the form of a living puppet, and afterwards, when
warmed in wool, she becomes a real girl. Whilst she
undergoes this transformation, the queen also gives birth
to a beautiful boy. The two children are considered as
twins, and baptized together. To the baptism of the
girl there comes as godmother, in a splendid chariot
drawn by six horses, a young woman dressed in rose-coloured
and golden robes, who shines like the sun, and
who, as she lets her veil drop, like the beautiful Argive
Helen, fills the bystanders with admiration. [The aurora,
who, before appearing in the form of a beautiful girl, is
enclosed in the wood of the forest, is a wooden puppet,
and becomes a wooden puppet once more when, fleeing
from the sun, she hides herself in a creeping-plant, like
the Hindoo Urvaçî (the first of the dawns), or in a laurel-plant,
like the Hellenic Daphne (the Vedic Dahanâ-aurora).
The aurora is born together with the sun; the
beautiful doll-maiden is born with the little prince. The
mother and the beneficent godmother seem to be the
moon, or a more ancient aurora.] The mother, dying,
leaves her daughter, putting it upon her breast, a gem
which is to bring her happiness; that is, the little basket
which contained the bird's egg, with the eggshell itself.
By means of the magical little basket, and by pronouncing
some magic words, the maiden can find all that she
searches or wishes for. The young man and woman end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
by marrying each other, having discovered that, although
both born of a king, they are children of different fathers;
they marry, and the little basket of happiness mysteriously
disappears.</p>

<p>Having drawn so far the general outline of the Turanian
boundaries of Slavonian tradition, it is now time to begin
to study the tradition of the Slaves itself, as far as it concerns
the myth and the legend of the bull and the cow.</p>

<p>The Russian peasants and shepherds are accustomed to
remark that the weather will be fine when a red cow
places herself at the head of the herd, and that it will
rain or be bad weather when, on the contrary, the first
of the cows to re-enter the stable at evening is a black
one. We already know what the black and the red cow
signify in the language of the Vedâs. The aurora of
morning and evening, that is, the red cows promise fine
weather; the cloud (or black cow) announces wet weather.
In Piedmont, when a beautiful evening aurora is observed,
it is the custom to say&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Rosso di sera,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Buon tempo si spera."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Red at eve, we hope for fine weather.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let us now follow the Russian tradition relating to the
cow and the bull in two of the many invaluable collections
of popular stories already printed in Russia, as well as
in the celebrated fables of Kriloff.<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
We shall begin with those stories and fables in which
the cow or the bull is explicitly mentioned. They show
us the bull who protects the hero and the heroine, the
bull who enriches the hero, the bull that is sold, the
grateful bull, the bull who sacrifices himself, the persecuted
bull, the demoniacal bull; the cow who spins, the
beneficent cow, the son of the cow, the birds that come
out from the cow, the cow's hide which becomes a rope
to mount up to heaven, the cow exchanged, the demoniacal
cow, the cow's horns. Here, again, therefore,
we have the double aspect of the Vedic cow; the dark-coloured
one (cloud and darkness), generally monstrous,
the luminous one (moon and aurora), usually divine and
beneficent.</p>

<p>One of the special characteristics of the bull and of the
cow is their capacity of drinking. We have already
seen how much the bull Indras (the sun in the cloud)
drank. In the third story of the first book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,
when the good maiden, persecuted by the witch, stretches
out a towel, and thus causes a river to arise, in order
that the witch may not overtake her, the latter leads
forward the bull to drink up the river (a form of the
Hindoo Agastyas, who, in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> absorbs
the sea). But the bull, who could dry up the river,
refuses to do so on account of a debt of gratitude he
owes to the good maiden. The water where this bull,
or cow, belonging to the witch, drinks, has the property
of transforming into a calf the man who drinks of it;<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
nay, to drink out of the hoof of the bull itself is enough
to turn him into a calf.<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> The water which comes out of
the hoof of the demoniacal bull is the opposite of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>water of Hippokrene, which flows from the hoofs of the
divine horse of the Hellenes, the Pêgasos.</p>

<p>In the second book of <i>Afanassieff</i>, there is a story
which speaks of the exchange of animals in the very same
order as in the <i>Âitareya-brâhma&#7751;am</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the gold for a
horse, the horse for a cow, the cow for a goat or sheep.
The Russian peasant goes on with his unfortunate
exchanges; he barters the sheep for a young pig, the
young pig for a goose, the goose for a duck, the duck for
a little stick with which he sees some children playing;
he takes the stick home to his wife, and she beats him
with it. In the twelfth story of the fifth book of
<i>Afanassieff</i>, an old man also begins to barter the golden
stockings and silver garters received in heaven from God
for a horse, the horse for a bull, the bull for a lamb; his
last exchange is for a little needle, which he loses. In
the second story of the sixth book, the same foolish
liberality is attributed to the third brother, the stupid
one (who, in another Russian variation of the same
story, is the cunning one), who, having learned that in
heaven cows are cheap, gives his cow for a fly, his ox for
a horse-fly, and mounts up to heaven.</p>

<p>But, generally speaking, the bull and the cow are the
beginning of good luck for the heroes of popular
tales.</p>

<p>In the fifty-second story of the fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,
the third brother, the truthful and fortunate fool, has, for
his inheritance from his father, one bull alone; he goes
to sell it, and passes a dry old tree, which rattles; thinking
that the tree wishes to buy his bull, he gives it,
promising to come back for the money. On his return
the bull is gone; he asks the tree for the money, and,
receiving no answer, proceeds to cut it down with his
hatchet, when from the tree there drops out a treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
which some robbers had hidden in it;<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> the young man
then takes it up and carries it home. In a variation of
the same story, in the collection of <i>Erlenwein</i>,<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> the third
son of the miller, before going to sell his bull, or ox, seeing
the second son milking the cow, endeavours to milk
the bull too; finding that his efforts are in vain, he
resolves upon selling an animal which appears to him
to be so utterly useless.</p>

<p>In the thirty-fourth story of the fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,
we meet again the two brothers, one rich and miserly, the
other poor; the poor one borrows from a neighbour two
bulls, and is conducted by Misery (gory) to a stone, under
which he finds a cavity full of gold. The poor man fills
his waggon, and, on coming out, tells Misery that there
is plenty more inside. Misery turns in to see; the ex-pauper
thereupon closes up the entrance with the stone,
and returns home.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>But the bull and the cow do not only provide the hero
with riches, they help him in danger. In the eleventh
story of <i>Erlenwein</i>,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> Ivan Tzarevi&#263;, or the Prince John,&mdash;the
name of the favourite hero of Slavonian popular tradition
(he is the third brother, the strongest, the most fortunate,
the victorious, the most intelligent, after having
been the most foolish)&mdash;wishes to flee from the serpent,
and, not knowing how, sits down on the trunk of a tree
and weeps. The hare comes to carry him away, but is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>killed by the serpent; the wolf comes, but is killed too.
At last the ox or bull comes, and carries him off. Ivan
having arrived at his dwelling, the ox has himself divided
in two; one part must be placed under the sacred images,
which ornament a corner of every room in Russian houses,
the other part under the window; Ivan must then look
out sharp till two dogs and two bears appear, who will
serve him in the chase, and be his strength.</p>

<p>In the twenty-seventh story of the fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,
Ivan Tzarevi&#263; and the beautiful Helen are pursued
by a monstrous bear with iron bristles; they escape upon
a bull (the moon), and Ivan, by the bull's advice, rides
him with his face turned towards the place whence the
pursuing bear is likely to come, in order that he may not
take them by surprise. When Ivan sees that the bear is
coming, the bull turns round and tears his eyes out; the
blind bear follows them still, but the fugitives pass a river
on the bull's back, in which the bear is drowned. Ivan
and Helen feel hungry; the bull tells them to cut him to
pieces and eat him, but to preserve his bones, and to
strike them together; from the bones of the bull, when
struck, a dwarf, the height of a finger-nail, but with a
beard a cubit long, comes out; he assists Ivan in finding
the milk of a wolf, a she-bear, and a lioness, until he is
swallowed by the burning bird, whose eggs he wished to
steal. (The bear is the night; the bull is the sun's steed
in the night, the moon; the bull-moon is sacrificed; then
comes forth a little sun with long rays, the dwarf with a
long beard, an <i>alter ego</i> of Ivan, who ends his life in the
burning furnace of the ph&#339;nix, or of the evening aurora.)
Ivan is threatened with death when the dwarf dies, but
he is at that moment helped by the wild beasts he had
tamed and fed, who save him from danger. These were,
as we have seen before, given to him after the death of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the bull, his deliverer, being born of the bull himself, cut
in pieces (the wild animals of the forest of night are born
as soon as the evening sun is sacrificed).</p>

<p>The same subject occurs again, with some variations,
in the twenty-eighth story, which follows; only instead
of John and Helen, we have John and Mary, the sun and
the aurora of the Christians. Near the abode of Ivan
and Mary a funeral pile arises, on which the bull sacrifices
himself. The bull's bones are sown in three furrows;
from the first furrow a horse comes forth, from the second
a dog, and in the third an apple-tree grows up. Ivan
mounts upon the horse, followed by the dog, and hunts
wolves' whelps and young bears, which he afterwards
tames and uses to kill the serpent, who has shut up his
dog in a cavern, and carried off his sister; he forces the
entrance of the place where the dog is hidden, by striking
the bolt of the door with three small branches of the apple-tree;
the bolt breaks into pieces, the door bursts open,
and the dog is delivered; dog, wolf, and young bear then
worry the serpent, and Ivan liberates the Princess Mary.</p>

<p>In the sixth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> the young Mary,
being persecuted, is miraculously assisted by a cow. An
old woman has three daughters of her own (of whom
one has one eye, another two, and the third three), and a
step-daughter called Mary; her own three do nothing,
and eat much; the step-daughter must work hard and
eat little. Her step-mother gives her for one night alone,
while she takes the cow to pasture, to spin, make into
skeins, weave, and bleach, the weight of five pounds.
The maiden goes to the pasture-ground, embraces her
variegated cow, leans on her neck and bewails her fate.
The cow says to her, "Beautiful girl, enter one of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
ears, and come out by the other, and all will be done."&mdash;In
the Italian variety of this story,<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> the cow spins with
her horns for the good maiden, whilst she combs the head
of the old woman or the Madonna. I think I have already
said that I recognise in this good old woman, fairy, or
Madonna, the moon. The moon, like the sun, is considered
as in relation with the aurora, and especially the evening
aurora, which she accompanies; she is the hostess, the
guide, and the protectress of the hero and heroine of
evening, lost and pursued in the night; after the evening
aurora, the white moon comes out, in the same way as
after the morning aurora the sun comes out in effulgence.
We have seen that the name of purifier, cleanser, is given
to the Vedic aurora; from this expression to the image
of comber or cleanser of the head of the old Madonna the
transition is easy;<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> from, <i>i.e.</i>, after, the aurora, the moon
comes out shining and clean, in a beautiful and serene
sky; and on this account pearls fall from the Madonna's
head; but when, on the other hand, the beautiful maiden,
the aurora, does not come, when the step-mother sends to
the pasture-ground, near the old woman, one of her own
daughters, foul lice fall from the head of the old fairy or
Madonna, inasmuch as the moon cannot show herself in
her splendour amid the shadows of the cloudy and black
night. The Russian story shows us how the beneficent
cow of the good maiden, who caresses her and serves her
well, and the Madonna or good old woman grateful for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>the careful combing of her hair of Italian tradition, are
one and the same thing. In the thirty-fifth story of the
fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>, on the contrary, where the cow
appears in a demoniacal aspect, whom the hero Ivan,
condemned from a prince to become a cowherd, must
kiss under her tail, which she lifts with this intent, we
meet with an old witch who sucks the white breasts of
the beautiful girl, while the latter is obliged to hunt the
vermin in her head; in the witch, as well as in the cow
who insolently lifts up her tail, we can recognise the
gloomy night, an explanation which is justified by the
fact that the hero-shepherd Katoma, the adorned one,
the agile-footed, ends by flaying the shameless cow (the
morning sun, shepherd of the luminous cows, takes off
the skin of the dark-coloured cow of the gloomy night).
But, to return to the fifty-fourth story.&mdash;When the stepmother
sees that the girl has done all the work assigned
her, she begins to suspect that there is some one who
helps her, and so sends next night her first daughter, who
has but one eye, to watch the daughter-in-law, who goes
to the pasture-ground. The young Mary then says to
her, "Eye, sleep;" and immediately her step-sister
falls asleep, thus allowing the cow to assist her without
any one perceiving it. The second night, the second
daughter, who has two eyes, is sent; Mary says twice to
her, "Eye, sleep," and obtains, without being seen, the
same favours from the cow. The third night, the third
sister, who has three eyes, is sent; Mary does not
remember the third eye, and only says twice, "Eye,
sleep:" and so the third sister sees with her remaining
eye<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> what the cow does with Mary, and in the morning
tells everything to her mother, who gives orders that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
cow be killed. Mary warns the cow; and the cow
recommends her to eat none of her flesh, to keep the
bones, sow them in the garden, and water them. The
maiden does so; every day, however hungry she may be,
she eats none of the meat, only collects the bones together.
From the bones sown in the garden arises a marvellous
apple-tree, with leaves of gold, and branches of silver,
which prick and wound the three daughters of the stepmother,
whilst, on the other hand, they offer apples to
the beautiful maiden, in order that she may present one
to the young and rich lord who is to make her his wife.
In the following story, the fifty-fifth, which is a variation
of the preceding one, the girl is named Mary, and her
husband Ivan Tzarevi&#263;; when she goes to the pasture,
and when she returns, she is accustomed to make
obeisance to the right foot of the cow. When the cow,
being killed, revives again in the shape of a tree, it swarms
with birds, which sing songs for kings and peasants alike,
and make the sweet fruits fall upon Mary's plate.</p>

<p>The apples that cause horns to grow, and those which
beautify and make young, mentioned in the thirty-sixth
story of the fifth book, and again in the last book of the
collection of <i>Afanassieff</i>, as well as in other European
variations of the same subject, are connected, in my
opinion, with the myth of the evening sky, and of the
lunar night, in the shape of an apple-tree. In the
fifteenth story of the collection of <i>Erlenwein</i>, the third
brother, the usual Ivan, comes to an apple-tree which
has red apples, and eats four of them, upon which
four horns grow on his head, to such a height that
he cannot enter the forest; he goes to an apple-tree that
bears white fruit, eats four apples, and the four horns disappear.
(The solar hero at evening approaches the tree
with the red apples, the evening aurora, and immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
becomes deformed; horns grow on his head; he loses
himself in the shades of night; in the moonlight and the
alba, he approaches the tree with the white apples, loses
his horns, and becomes young and beautiful again.)</p>

<p>In the fifty-seventh story of the sixth book of <i>Afanassieff's</i>
collection, Ivan Tzarevi&#263; is presented with the
apples which restore youth to him who eats them, by the
sister of the sun, to whose abode he is lifted in the following
manner: Ivan (the sun) has for his sister (no doubt
half-sister) a serpent-witch (night), who has already
devoured his father and mother (the sun and the aurora
of evening, which create the night, and are destroyed by
it); the witch persecutes her little brother Ivan, and endeavours
to eat him; he flees, and she overtakes him in the
vicinity of the dwelling of the sister of the sun (the aurora,
the true sister of Ivan). The witch makes a proposal
to Ivan, that they be weighed together in the scales.
Ivan accepts this proposal, upon which the one enters the
one scale, and the other the other; no sooner does the
witch put her foot on the scale than, as she weighs so much
more than Ivan, he is lifted up to heaven, the dwelling
of the sister of the sun, where he is welcomed and admitted.
(A beautiful myth, of which the meaning is evident.
Ivan is the sun, the aurora is his sister; at morning, near
the abode of the aurora, that is, in the east, the shades of
night go underground, and the sun arises to the heavens;
this is the mythical pair of scales. Thus, in the Christian
belief, St Michael weighs human souls: those who weigh
much sink down into hell, and those who are light arise
to the heavenly paradise.)</p>

<p>By means of the sister of the sun, Ivan saves himself
from the witch. In another story in <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
means of the sister of the hero Nikanore, the same Ivan,
running after the cows, causes them to have golden horns
and tails, with sides formed of stars; and afterwards, with
the assistance of the hero Nikanore in person (of the sun,
that is, of himself), he kills the serpent.</p>

<p>We have already seen the cloudy and the gloomy sky
represented in the Vedic poems, now as a black cow, now
as a stable which encloses the bulls and cows. The black
bull or cow of night is considered to be demoniacal.
In a story given in <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> we find the devil in the
shape of a bull, which bellows, and throws up the earth
with its horns, arresting a nuptial procession. From a
bull he turns into a bear, then a hare, and then a crow,
to put obstacles in the way of the marriage, until, having
presented himself in the form of a devil, a soldier-hero
blinds him while he is drinking. A variation of this
soldier is the third son of the peasant,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> who is so strong
that with a snap of his fingers he makes the bull and the
bear fall dead, and then by a single pinch strips off their
skins. The same hero hires himself to a merchant, whom
he engages to serve for two years, on condition of receiving
as his reward, at the end of them, the permission
to give him a snap with the fingers and a pinch. The
merchant thinks he is getting the man's service for
nothing, but pays for it with his life. The merchant
seldom plays a good part in popular stories. He and
the miser are synonymous,&mdash;the miser is the monster
which keeps treasures hidden; and on this account, as we
have already seen in the Vedic hymns themselves, the
enemies of the gods, the monsters that ravish and conceal
the treasures, are represented as pa&#7751;ayas or merchants,
cheats, robbers, or misers. The currency of this epithet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>as a term of infamy must have been owing in part to
the dislike with which the priestly sacrificers of the last
Vedic period regarded the merchants, in whom they saw
only a pack of misers, because, on account of their
wandering life, they had neither cows nor bulls to give
them for sacrifice, but carried with them all their fortune,
and did not require the fertilising rain of the god Indras
to multiply their gold and their silver.</p>

<p>The celestial bull comes out of the night or the nocturnal
stables either, as we have seen, to help the hero,
to be sacrificed, to flee from persecution, or because he
has been stolen by a skilful thief.</p>

<p>In one of Kriloff's fables, God sends a terrible plague
among the animals, of which they perish in great numbers.
They are so terrified by it that they forsake their
habits, and begin to wander aimlessly hither and thither.
The wolf no longer eats the sheep; the fox leaves the hens
unmolested; the turtle-doves no longer make love to each
other. Then the lion holds a council of the animals, and
exhorts them all to confess their faults. The cunning fox
essays to quiet the lion-judge by assuring him that though
he stole some sheep, he did not thereby commit a fault;
and so he justifies his own ravages; as also do the bear,
the tiger, the wolf, and all the most wicked of the
animals. Then the simple bull comes forward, and, in
his turn, confesses that he stole a little hay from the
priest. This crime appears so heinous that the council
of animals sentences the bull to be offered in sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes, on the contrary, the bull, either because
he cannot bear the bad treatment that he receives from
his masters, or in order to avoid the danger of being
killed or sold by the stupid son, who is in need of money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
that he may marry a wife, a danger of which he has a
presentiment, abandons the stable with other animals,
constructs a hut or isbà and shuts himself up in it.<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
He has with him the lamb, the goose, the cock, or else
some other tame animals. The fox passes by, hears the
crowing of the cock, and goes to call his friends the bear
and the wolf to help him. The bear opens the door, the
fox enters, and the bull by goring him with his horns,
the lamb by butting against his sides, and the cock by
pecking his eyes out, put an end to the unwelcome intruder.
The wolf, who goes in, curious to see what is
going on, has the same fate, and the bear, who comes
last, only succeeds with great difficulty, and after having
been severely maltreated, in effecting his escape. In
another variation of the same story, the bear dies of fear,
and the stupid son takes his skin, sells it and makes
money; then, the danger of being sold having passed by,
the bull and his company return home. The battle
between the tame and the savage animals, won by the
former, is an expression in zoological form of the victory
of the heroes (the sun and the moon) over the monsters
of darkness.</p>

<p>The story of the hero-thief is generally connected with
the carrying off of his master's horse; but not unfrequently
the hero, like the monster, becomes a robber of cows and
oxen.</p>

<p>The thief Ivan<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> is required to steal from his master a
black bull or ox tied to the plough; if he succeeds, he is
to have a hundred roubles for his reward; but if he does
not, he is to receive instead a hundred bastinadoes. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>order to steal it, Ivan adopts the following device: he
takes a cock, plucks it, and puts it alive under a clod
of earth. The ploughmen come with the oxen; while
they are ploughing, the cock starts up; they leave the
plough to run after it, upon which Ivan, who was hidden
behind a bush, comes out. He cuts off one ox's tail and
puts it in another ox's mouth, and then leads away the
black ox. The ploughmen, not having been able to
overtake the cock, come back, and when they see only
two animals instead of three, conclude that one ox has
eaten the black ox and is beginning to eat the tail of the
other, the variegated ox. In the twenty-first story of the
fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>, the boy-dwarf steals an ox
from the priest and eats its tripe.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>From the cow the hero is born; under a putrid cow
thrown into a ditch lies Ivan Tzarevi&#263;; a bird takes the
water off and Ivan Tzarevi&#263; comes forth.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> In another
story of <i>Afanassieff</i>, the fox-heroine, companion of the
wolf, whilst the wolf is absent, eats the intestines of the
calf, their common property (which they had received
from cowherds in exchange for a certain cake contaminated
by their excrement, the usual excrement
which is the beginning of riches); she then fills the
calf or cow with straw and sparrows, and departs. The
wolf returns, is astonished that the calf should have
eaten so much straw that it comes out, and draws out the
straw. The birds fly away, the calf falls, and the wolf
flees away terrified.<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> With these two myths are connected
two more, that of the son of the cow and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>that of the ascent into heaven by means of the cow's
hide.</p>

<p>The king has no sons; he catches a pike, which the
cook washes, giving thereafter the dirty water to the cow
to drink; the fish they give to the black girl to carry to
the queen; the black girl eats a piece of it on the way,
and the queen eats what remains. At the expiration of
nine months, the cow, the maid, and the queen, give
each birth to a son. The three sons resemble each
other completely; but the son of the cow, the hero-tempest,
is the strongest of the three brothers, and
accomplishes the most difficult enterprises. In another
variation of the same story, in <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> instead of the
cow we have the bitch giving birth to the strongest of
the three brothers.<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> In the nineteenth story of <i>Erlenwein</i>,
instead of the cow and the bitch, we have the mare; the
strongest brother is here the son of the black girl, Burghraver
or the hero-tempest (Burya-Bagatír). In the third
story of <i>Erlenwein</i>, Ivan Tzarevi&#263; appears as the son of
the black girl. As in numerous other Russian stories, Ivan
Tzarevi&#263;, usually the third brother, appears not only (as)
the most skilful, but the strongest of the brothers, we
are driven to recognise in the three brothers, the son of the
black girl, the son of the cow, and the queen's son, who
alternately accomplish the same heroic undertakings, the
same solar personage, whose mother, Night, is represented
now as a queen, now as a cow (we have just seen Ivan
Tzarevi&#263; come out of the putrid cow), now as a black
slave (the negro washerwoman, the Saracen woman of
Italian stories [Holda]; the cleaned fish which is carried
by the black girl may perhaps be a link connecting the
imagery of Russian tradition with that of Italian legend).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>In the second story of the fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,
the third brother, the cunning one, by means of the hides
of his cows and oxen converted into thongs, ascends into
heaven; thus, in a variation of the same story, the third
brother thinks to let himself down by the cow's hide, cut
into pieces and made into thongs, being fastened to the
confines of heaven; but he perceives on the way that the
thong is not long enough. Some peasants are threshing
corn, and the chaff rises into the air; he tries to make a
rope with this chaff, but the rope breaks and he falls to
the ground. This successful ascent into heaven, followed
by an unlucky descent, is often referred to, with curious
details, in Russian popular legend; to which a play of
words in the language must have not a little contributed.
It is as follows, "He who mounts does not descend,"<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> <i>i.e.</i>,
when one is doing one thing he cannot be doing the contrary.
This elementary truth was afterwards altered by
changing the tenses. "He who has been able to ascend
will not be able to come down again;" which is only
partly true, and means that while in dreams we require
only a thin thread to mount up high, when we wish to
come down from the world of dreams to that of reality,
the fall is heavy; we come down with leaden wings,
with that difficulty in breathing which oppresses us in
dreams when we seem to fall from a height with painful
slowness. And as at the end of the dream, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
painful fall from the sky, we awaken alive, so the story
does not say of the hero who fell from heaven that he is
dead, only that his dreams are dead. He is only unlucky
when, the second time, he attempts the descent with a
greater weight.</p>

<p>While reasonings such as these may have helped to
diffuse the myths, I believe that the myths, at their formation,
pleased more as images of nature than of reason,
and as the images of mythology are almost all celestial,
so in the third brother, or old man of other varieties of
the story, who mounts up to heaven and comes down
again by means of the cow's hide, I always recognise the
sun. The old man who ascends into heaven, after the
cow is dead, does so also by means of a vegetable of
funereal omen which grows up in a marvellous manner.</p>

<p>An old man and an old woman have one daughter;
she eats some beans and lets one fall to the ground; a
plant (the moon) grows up till it reaches the sky. The
old man mounts up and then comes back again. He
tries to take his wife up in a sack, but unable to bear
the weight, he lets her fall to the ground, when she dies.<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>A cabbage grows up near an old man's dwelling, till
in like manner it rises up to the sky. The old man
climbs up, makes a hole in the sky, and eats and drinks
to satiety. He then returns and narrates everything to
his wife. She wishes to go up too; when they are half
way, the old man lets the sack drop, the old woman
dies, and her husband prepares her funeral, calling in the
fox<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> as a mourner.</p>

<p>Other variations of the same story offer us, instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>the cow's hide, the cabbage, and the beanstalk, the pea-plant,
and even the oak-tree, which grows up to heaven.<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p>From the vegetable or funereal plant,&mdash;a symbol, as we
have already remarked, at once of abundance and resurrection,&mdash;by
which the hero ascends to heaven, where he
finds riches and abundance of food, the transition was
very natural to the pea which turns round, of which the
hero Turn-little-Pea (the son of the king of the peas) is
born.</p>

<p>In the second story of the third book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
Turn-little-Pea appears as the third of the brothers, as
the youngest brother, who delivers his sister and his two
brothers from the monster. But the ungrateful brothers
(perhaps covetous of the maiden, here called a sister, but,
who is virtually the same, the bride delivered and disputed
for by the three brothers in numerous Indo-European
legends), tie him to an oak-tree and go home alone.
Turn-little-Pea unroots the whole oak and goes off. He
afterwards kills three more monster-serpents, and the
she-serpents their wives.</p>

<p>In the thirtieth story of the second book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,
this enterprise against the serpents, male and female, is
attributed to the usual Ivan. He goes with his brothers
against the serpent with twelve heads, and with his iron
stick alone kills nine of them, and the three remaining ones
by the help of his two brothers. Then the she-serpent
and her three daughters persecute the three brothers, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>Ivan in particular. She causes them to find a beautiful
cushion upon the ground; Ivan, who is suspicious of
some trick, first beats the cushion, upon which blood
gushes out of it (in the story of <i>Turn-little-Pea</i>, the
young hero averts the danger by making the sign of the
cross with his sword, when blood comes out). The
serpent then tempts them by an apple-tree with gold
and silver apples. The brothers wish to pluck some;
Ivan, however, first strikes the tree, and blood flows
from it. They then come to a beautiful fountain, where
the brothers would like to drink; Ivan strikes the
fountain, and again blood comes from it. The cushion,
the apple-tree, and the fountain were the three daughters
of the serpent. Then the serpent, having failed to deceive
them, rushes upon Ivan; the latter escapes with his
brothers into a forge shut by twelve iron gates; the
serpent licks the doors with her tongue to force a passage,
and her tongue is caught with red-hot pincers.</p>

<p>In the fourth story of <i>Erlenwein</i>, the three brothers
occur again with interesting mythical names. A woman
bears three sons; one at evening, who is on this account
called Ve&#263;ernik, or the evening one; the second at
midnight, whence he is named Poluno&#263;nik, or the midnight
one; the third at the aurora, who is named
Svetazór, or the clearly-seeing. The three brothers
become adults in a few hours. The most valiant of the
three is Svetazór, the last one. To prove his strength,
he goes to the blacksmith and orders an iron club that
weighs twelve puds (480 pounds); he throws it into the
air and catches it on the palm of his hand, the club
breaks. He orders one of twenty puds (800 pounds),
throws it up, catches it on his knee, and it breaks.
Finally he orders one of thirty puds (1200 pounds),
throws it up, and catches it on his forehead; it bends but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
does not break. Svetazór has it straightened and takes
it with him, as he goes with his two brothers to deliver
the three daughters of the Tzar, carried off by three
magicians into the three castles of copper, silver, and gold.
Svetazór, after having drunk the water of strength, and
received from the first princess an egg of copper, from
the second one of silver, and from the third a golden
one, delivers the three princesses and brings them out.
The two brothers, seeing that the third princess is more
beautiful than the others, think that the youngest brother
is reserving her for himself, and throw him into the water.
Svetazór wanders about the subterranean world, and
delivers the daughter of another Tzar by killing a
monster and burying him under a rock. A soldier
boasts before the Tzar of having accomplished this heroic
act. Svetazór invites the soldier to prove his strength,
and so the truth of his boast, by lifting the rock up. He
does not succeed, and Svetazór wins the trial of strength,
upon which the soldier is executed by order of the Tzar.
After this, Svetazór, for having once spared the life of a
crow, is carried by it into the world of the living, on
condition that he gives it something to eat by the way.
Svetazór has at length to feed the crow with his own
flesh, yet is in the end set down again safe and sound,
with all his flesh, in the world above, where, with the
eggs of copper, silver, and gold, he causes the castles
formed of these metals to arise, in which are found
the ring, the slipper, and the robe demanded from their
bridegrooms by the three princesses, who hoped by this
expedient to see again their lost Svetazór. Then Svetazór
begins to sweep out the terrace of the golden castle.
The third princess expresses her intention to take
him for her husband. The nuptials are celebrated,
Svetazór pardoning his two elder brothers and giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
them the two elder sisters of his bride. (The princess of
the copper is the evening aurora, the princess of the
silver is the silvery moon, and that of the gold is the
morning aurora, to whom Svetazór, the clearly-seeing,
the illumined, the sun, is married.)</p>

<p>In the sixth story of the first book of <i>Afanassieff</i>, the
same undertaking is accomplished by the third brother,
Ivan. The monster which carries off the three sisters is
an aquatic one, an otter. Abandoned by his brothers in
the nether world, Ivan is overtaken by a great tempest;
he takes pity upon some young birds that are bathing,
and saves them under his dress, upon which the grateful
mother of the birds brings him back to the upper world.
In the fifteenth story of <i>Erlenwein</i>, the third brother is
the cunning one, who, by a stratagem, and by means of
his purse, which is self-replenishing, steals from his two
brothers the snuff-box out of which issue as many armies
as are wished for, and the cloth which makes the wearer
invisible (both figures to represent the cloud from which
come forth riches, solar rays, thunderbolts, and weapons,
and which hides the hero, that is, renders him invisible).
In the fifty-fourth story of the fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,
Ivan of the dog, the hero sacrificed by his brothers, is the
strong one, he who delivers the three princesses, who
possesses the three rings, and gives them to the goldsmith
from whom they were ordered, and who is not
able to make them, by which means he is recognised.</p>

<p>Ivan Tzarevi&#263;, inasmuch as he was born of a cow, as we
have also seen above, was necessarily represented as a
bull; the bull displays part of his strength by drinking;
Ivan Tzarevi&#263; drinks, at a gulp, whole barrels of wine
of marvellous strength. In this capacity he resembles
Indras, the great drinker of somas, and the drinker
Bhîmas, the second brother of the Pâ&#7751;&#7693;avas.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>The third brother is now Prince Ivan (Ivan Tzarevi&#263;,
Ivan Karolievi&#263;, Ivan Kralievi&#263;), now the stupid Ivan
(Ivan durak), Ivan the little fool (Ivan Dura&#263;iok). But, as
I have already remarked, the fool generally makes his fortune,
either because the kingdom of heaven is for the poor
in spirit, or because the stupidity of Ivan is feigned, or else
because the fool becomes wise. In a story given in <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
the fool is also lazy, and takes the name of Emilius.</p>

<p>Emilius is sent with a barrel to draw water; he only
goes on account of the promise made him by his sister,
that he will receive as a reward a pair of red boots.&mdash;This
desire of the boy-hero, and of the girl-heroine, is spoken
of in many popular songs, and among others, in a Piedmontese
one, as yet unpublished. In the seventeenth story
of the fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> the sister kills her
brother, Little John, to possess herself of his red strawberries
(as in the Esthonian tale), and his red little shoes.
Upon his grave a fine cane grows; a shepherd makes a
flute of it, and the flute, pressed to the lips, begins to
emit the following lamentation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gently, gently, little shepherd, play;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Do not wound my heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My little sister, the traitress,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For the red little strawberries, for the red little shoes!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the flute is pressed to the sister's lips, instead of the
word "little shepherd," it says, "Little sister, thou hast
betrayed me,"<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> and her crime is thus discovered. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>little red shoes are simply a variation of the slippers which
are lost by the fugitive aurora, and found again by the
sun, and which both wish to wear. (I refer to this myth
the origin of the nuptial custom in Europe of maidens,
towards the new year, throwing the slipper to know whether,
during the next year, they will be married, and who
is to be their husband.)<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> The slipper lost by the maiden,
Little Mary (Masha, the Marion of Piedmontese and
French legends), and found by the prince, also occurs in
the Russian tales. In the thirtieth of the sixth book of
<i>Afanassieff</i>, Little Mary's elder sister begins by trying
on the slipper; but it is too small; the foot will not go
in. Seeing this, Little Mary's step-mother advises her
daughter to cut off her great toe, which would not enter;
then the foot goes in, and the messengers of the prince
lead the eldest sister away; but two doves fly after them
and cry out, "Blood on her foot, blood on her foot." The
deceit is discovered, and the eldest sister sent back; the
prince causes his true and predestined bride, Little Mary,
to be carried off. (This is the usual exchange of wives,
upon which I have remarked in my "Essay on the Comparative
History of Nuptial Usages," and of which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
legend of Queen Berta is one of the most popular
examples. The Russian Little Mary, like Cinderella, is
at first of ugly aspect, and then beautiful. In the Russian
story, the maiden becomes beautiful by mounting upon
the stove. Sîtâ comes forth, beautiful in her innocence,
passing through the fire; the morning aurora only seems
beautiful when it passes through the flames of the Eastern
sky. The stove brings us back to the interrupted story
of the foolish and lazy Emilius (or Ivan).&mdash;On account,
therefore, of the promise made to him of the red boots,
he goes to the fountain with the barrel to draw water.
In the fountain he catches a pike, who beseeches him to
set him at liberty, and promises in return to make him
fortunate. Being lazy, the greatest favour that he wishes
for at this moment is that he may be helped to carry the
barrel; the grateful pike performs the miracle of the
barrel full of water which walks of its own accord. (I
have already endeavoured to explain this myth: the
cloud is represented as a barrel in the Vedic hymns; it
moves on of its own accord; the barrel does the same; the
hero, as long as he is shut up in the cloud, remains
foolish; the barrel of the fool walks of itself.) Emilius
is then sent to cut wood; by favour of the grateful pike,
it is enough for him to send his hatchet, which cuts the
wood of itself; the wood piles itself upon the waggon,
and the waggon, without being drawn by any one,
advances, passing or crushing whatever it meets; they
endeavour to arrest its progress, when the trunk of an
oak-tree detaches itself from the waggon, and, like a stick,
beating on every side, sweeps the road (these are all
curious variations of the walking forest or cloud). The
Tzar then sends to invite him to court, and knowing his
weak penchant for things of a red colour, he promises
him a red robe, a red hat, and red boots. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Tzar's envoys arrive, Emilius, like his <i>alter ego</i> Ivan
Durak (Ivan the fool), is warming himself at the stove;
grudging all trouble, he obtains from the pike the favour
of being carried by the stove itself to the Tzar at court.
The Tzar's daughter falls in love with him; the Tzar
shuts the young couple up in a cask (the usual cloud-barrel,
which occurs in the form of a little chest in other
stories, a variation of the wooden dress), and has them
thrown into the sea. Emilius, who was drunk in the
cask, sleeps; the princess wakens him, and beseeches
him to save her; by means of the pike, the cask comes
to a beautiful island, where it breaks open; Emilius
becomes handsome, rich, and happy in a beautiful palace
with the young princess. (The aurora and the sun of
evening are thrown together into the ocean of night, until
they land on the happy isle of the east, where they reappear
again together in all their splendour.) One of the
most popular stupidities of the fool is that of letting the
wine contained in the barrel flow out upon the ground,
when he is left alone at home; in the Russian story, too,
Ivan the fool leaves the beer that is fermenting in the
barrel open (Indras with his lightning makes a hole in
the cloud-barrel, and the rain comes out).<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>The fool Ivan takes his good luck from the living, but
he also does so from the dead. On account of having
watched three nights by the tomb of his father, his luck
begins,<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> the shade of his father having blessed him; but,
as the dead bring good luck (a belief which, at any rate,
has always been entertained by the heirs of rich men
deceased), the third brother speculates on the body of his
own mother. We do not know whether he does so out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>of pure simplicity, or with some hidden and far-seeing
design, presumable from the ease with which he exchanges
the character of a fool for that of a cunning schemer (the
first Brutus of popular tradition). In the seventeenth
story of <i>Erlenwein</i>, after he has carried a treasure home,
by selling his ox to the tree, and then cutting down the
tree, which contains money, he always guards his money,
and sleeps upon it. His brothers know this, and resolve
to go and kill him. But that very night, the third, the
foolish brother, leaves his mother in charge of the treasure;
the brothers come and kill his mother by mistake,
instead of him. He turns up, and threatens to give
them up to justice; they bribe him with a hundred
roubles to keep silence. Then the third brother takes
his mother's body and carries it into the middle of the
road, in order that a merchant's waggon may crush it;
when this happens, he accuses the merchant of murder,
until the latter gives him a hundred more roubles to say
nothing about it. He then comes to a village by night
with his mother's corpse; he places it against a peasant's
door, and knocks at the window; the peasant opens the
door, the body falls, and the peasant treads upon it, upon
which the so-called stupid son cries out that he has killed
his mother, and receives another hundred roubles, on
promise of silence. Then the two elder brothers, finding
that it is possible to speculate upon corpses, and make
one's fortune, kill their wives, and go to town with their
bodies; they are immediately arrested and put into prison.</p>

<p>The law of atavism evolves itself in the generation of
the heroes of mythical legends, no less than in that of
simple mortals upon earth. Of a stupid father is born a
wise son, and then the wise son in turn has a foolish one.
I do not as yet know how to explain this singular fact of
natural history; its appearance in mythology, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
is not difficult to understand. To the luminous day succeeds
the gloomy night, and then again to the dark night
the luminous day; to summer succeeds winter, and to
winter summer; to white black, and to black white; to
heat cold, and to cold heat.</p>

<p>On this account, in legends, when the mother is intelligent,
the son, generally speaking, is silly; whereas, when
the mother is silly,<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> the son is usually intelligent.</p>

<p>In the fifth story of the sixth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>, a
soldier enters the house of a woman, while her son is
travelling, and induces her to believe that he has just
returned from hell, where he had seen her son employed
in taking the storks to pasture, and greatly in want of
money; the soldier says that he is about to return to
hell, and will be happy to take with him whatever the
woman wishes to send to her son. The credulous woman
gives him some money, directing him to take it immediately
to hell, and give it to her poor child. The soldier
disappears, and shortly afterwards the woman's son returns
home; his mother is greatly astonished at his appearance,
and tells him how she has been deceived; he gets angry
and leaves the house again, swearing never to return till
he finds some one more foolish than his mother. He is a
skilful thief; he steals from a lady, whilst her husband is
absent, a hog with its little pigs, and puts them in safe
concealment; the husband returns, hears what has taken
place, and follows the thief with a carriage and horses.
The robber hears him coming; squats down on the
ground, takes off his hat, and pretends to be covering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
with it a bird or a falcon, which wishes to escape. The
husband comes and asks him if he has seen the robber;
the latter answers that he has seen him, but that he is a
long way off, and that the roads by which he can be
overtaken are many and winding. The husband, who,
perhaps, does not know the proverb which says, "Who
wishes, let him go; who wishes not, let him send," asks
the robber to overtake the fugitive; the thief demurs,
saying that he has under his hat a falcon, which cost his
master three hundred roubles, and that it may escape.
The gentleman promises to take care of it, and if the
falcon escapes, to pay the three hundred roubles. The
thief does not believe his promise, and desires the three
hundred roubles in pledge of his good faith; the gentleman
gives them, and the thief goes off with the carriage,
the horses, and the three hundred roubles. The gentleman
stays till evening looking at the hat, waiting for his
friend to return; at last he loses patience, wants to see
what there is under the hat, and finds nothing&mdash;but a
proof of his own stupidity.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>Ivan (John), and oftener still Vaniusha (Little John,
the Giovannino of Italian legends), distinguishes himself,
not only by his thieving accomplishments, but also by his
courage. In order to play the part of a thief, as Little
John does in all the Indo-Europeans legends, not only
industry, but courage must be called into requisition;
hence he acquires, like the Chevalier Bayard, the good
reputation of a hero without fear and without reproach.
The hero Ivan is now the son of a king, now of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
merchant, and now of a peasant; the merchants wished,
no less than the peasants, to appropriate to themselves the
most popular hero of tradition. In the forty-sixth story
of the fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>, neither the shades of
night, nor brigands, nor death, can make the hero afraid;
but he is terrified and dies, falling into the water, when
the little <i>iersh</i> (the perch) leaps upon his stomach, whilst
he is asleep in his fishing-boat. In the Tuscan story,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> the
fearless hero Giovannino, after having confronted every
kind of danger, dies from the terror the sight of his
own shadow inspires him with. In the same way, in the
<i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, the god Indras, terrified at his own shadow,
or, probably, that of his dead enemy, takes to flight after
the killing of the serpent Ahis.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>The following heroes are also variations of Prince
Ivan, Ivan the son of the cow, Ivan the peasant's son,
Ivan the merchant's son, and the cunning Ivan:&mdash;1st,
Alessino Papovi&#263;, the son of the priest (it is well known
that the Russian priests are not bound to celibacy), who
kills Tugarin, the son of the serpent, by prayer, that is,
by praying to the Holy Mother of God, to order the black
cloud to cause drops of rain to fall on the monster's
wings, upon which the son of the serpent, like the Vedic
Ahis, when Indras opens a way for the rivers to come

<p>The legend of the hero Ivan has yet other interesting
forms, reflective of the beautiful Vedic myth of the Açvinâu,
who into their flying chariot-vessel also take up the unhappy.
In <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> the third brother, thought to
be foolish, is ill-treated by his parents, who dress and
feed him badly. The king issues a proclamation, that
whoever can make a flying vessel will obtain his daughter
to wife. The mother sends forth her three sons in quest
of the necessary enchantment; to her third son she gives
a little brown bread and water, whilst the two eldest go
provided with good white loaves and some brandy. The
fool meets on the way a poor old man, salutes him, and
begins to share with him his scanty store of food; the
old man transmutes his brown bread into white, and his
water into brandy, and then advises him to enter the
forest, to make the sign of the cross upon the first tree
he finds, and to strike it with his axe; then to throw
himself on the ground and stay there until he wakens;
he will see a vessel ready before him: "Sit down in
it," added the old man, "and fly whither your behest
requires you; and by the way take up beside you as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>many as you meet."<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> This chariot is freighted with
abundance, both to eat and to drink; the young man
overtakes several needy beggars, and invites them up
into the chariot; he receives only poor people, not a
single rich man.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> But these poor men afterwards show
their gratitude to the hero, and help him in other adventures
imposed upon him by the Tzar, who hopes by this
means to get rid of a son-in-law of such vulgar origin.
One of the new tasks imposed requires him to eat
twelve oxen, and to drink at one gulp forty barrels of
wine; in this he is helped by Eating (Abiédalo) and by
Drinking (Apiválo), whom he had entertained in his
chariot-ship, and who eat and drink instead of him.<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>
At last he comes to claim and marry the young princess.
(The hero-sun, taken up into the chariot of the Açvinâu,
by the grace of the Açvinâu, invoked by him in danger,
is delivered, and espouses the aurora.)</p>

<p>In a variation of this legend, a prince, fifteen years of age,
who has been lost by his parents, is found again by means
of a riddle which they propose, and which he alone
can solve.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> In the Vedic hymns it is now the aurora, the
beautiful maiden, who delivers the hero-sun, and now the
hero-sun who delivers the beautiful maiden, the aurora.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>In the forty-first story of the sixth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,
a little girl, seven years old (semilietká), presents herself
to the Tzar, who must marry her, inasmuch as she solves
the riddle proposed by him, by arriving riding on a hare
(an animal which represents the moon), with a quail (an
animal which seems to represent the sun) tied to her
hand.<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> She too, like the aurora, knows all; she too
protects the poor against the rich, and the innocent
against the guilty. The dwarf Allwis is a form of
this child. Allwis is the omniscient man of the Edda,
who solves all the questions put to him by the god
Thor, in order to obtain his daughter; when he is
done with answering these questions, day breaks, and
the sun shines.</p>

<p>The wondrous girl of seven years of age (the aurora),
brings us back to the marvellous puppet (generally, the
moon). It is three puppets (the wooden chest of Marion
d'bosch, or wooden little Mary of the Piedmontese story,
the dark forest of night, the tree that hides the splendid
treasures of the evening aurora; another variety of the
same myth in relation to the sun) that hide the three
splendid dresses of the stars, the moon and the sun,
which belong to the beautiful maiden, the daughter of
the priest (a variation of the Vedic aurora, duhitar divas,
or daughter of the sky). It is the three puppets which
enable the beautiful girl to descend through the ground,
and so escape from the persecutions of her father and
seducer (in other versions, of her brother), and which go
down with her, dressed as old women, and enter a
forest, where, near an oak-tree, there is the house of a
princess, who has a young and handsome son.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> In a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>variation of this story,<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> the girl is persecuted, not by her
father, but the well-known cruel stepmother, for whom
she divides the wheat from the barley, and draws water
at the fountain (like the Vedic maiden Apalâ); she goes
three times splendidly dressed to church (which takes
the place of the ball-room of other stories), where she is
seen three times by a handsome prince; she is twice
followed, and twice disappears; the third time the prince
has gum (pitch, in other variations) put on the ground;
the fugitive loses her golden slipper in consequence,
which the prince picks up, and tries on all the maidens
till he finds his bride. In another story,<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> where the
relation of the aurora with the two Açvinâu comes out
in wonderful distinctness,<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> it is by means of her marvellous
speaking puppet (<i>i.e.</i>, the moon, the Vedic Rakâ,
very small, but very intelligent, enclosed in the wooden
dress, in the forest of night) that the girl, persecuted by
her step-mother, weaves a cloth so fine that it can pass
like a thread through the eye of a needle (just as the
girl's feet are very small, so also are the puppet's hands).
The marvellous cloth is brought to the Tzar, but no one
is found who is able to sew it into a shirt for the Tzar.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
The maiden alone, by the help of her puppet, succeeds;
the Tzar wishes to see the girl who prepared his extraordinary
shirt, and goes to find her; he is astonished at
her beauty, and marries her. In the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, the
aurora weaves a robe for her husband the sun.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>The same girl (the aurora) whom we have here only as
a good, beautiful, intelligent, and skilful maiden, appears
in other stories given in <i>Afanassieff</i> as a heroic damsel.
In the seventh story of the first book she disguises herself
as a man, and mocks the Tzar three times. In the
fourteenth story of the first book, the same girl, under
the name of Anastasia the beautiful, vanquishes and
binds the serpent, and discovers the secret of how he can
be killed. Under the name of Helen, or Little Helen,
she is the protectress of her little brother, Ivanusca
(Little John),<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and his guide through the world; and
when the boy, by the incantation of a witch, is transformed
into a lamb or kid (in a story of the Canavese, in
Piedmont, the seven monks, brothers of the courageous
girl, are transformed into seven hogs), she recommends
him to the care of the prince, her husband, in order that
he may destroy the evil work of the witch. The same
maiden is found again as the very wise Basilia (Vasilisa
Premudraia), who succours the young hero, because,
after stealing her dress while she was bathing in the sea,
he restores it to her, agreeably to her prayer. For this
favour she gratefully accomplishes for him the labours
imposed upon him by the king of the waters, and ends,
after many vicissitudes, by marrying him.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> She appears
once more as the royal maiden (Tzar-dievitza), who comes
three times with her ships by sea to lead away the young
Ivan, beloved by her;<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> and I also place among the girl-heroines
the daughter of the shepherd in the twenty-ninth
story of the fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>, of which this is an
abridgment. There was once a king who could not find
a maiden beautiful enough to suit his taste. One day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>returning from the chase (the solar hero always meets the
aurora, his bride, when returning from the hunt in the
forest of night), he meets a shepherd's daughter, who is
leading out the flock to pasture, so beautiful that her
like would be sought for in vain over the world. He
becomes enamoured of her, and promises to make her his
wife, but only on condition that she will never say anything
displeasing to him, whatever he may do; the poor
enamoured maiden consents, the nuptials are celebrated,
and the couple live together happily for a year. A boy
is born to them; then the king says roughly to his wife
that the boy must be killed, that it may never be said the
heir to the throne is the son of a shepherdess. The poor
woman resigns herself to her fate, remarking, "The will
of the king must be done." Another year passes, and a
daughter is born. The king informs his wife that she too
must be killed, as she can never become a princess, but
will always remain a peasant girl. The unhappy mother
once more bows her head to the will of the king, who,
however, consigns his son and daughter, not to an executioner,
but to his sister, that they may receive all the
attentions due to their royal pedigree and standing.
Years pass away; the little prince and princess grow up
beautiful, healthy, good, and happy, and pass adolescence.
Then the king puts his wife to the last proof. He sends
her back to her house in the dress of a shepherdess,
signifying at the same time that she has lived with him
long enough. Then he orders her to return, to put the
rooms in order, and to wait upon the new bride whom he
intends to take her place; the shepherd's daughter obeys
again without a murmur. The new bride arrives, and
is set down at the table; they eat, drink, and are merry;
the shepherd's daughter is obliged to see and hear all,
and to serve in silence; at last the king asks her, "Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
is not my bride beautiful?" To which the unhappy
woman responds with a heroic effort, "If she seem
beautiful to thee, still more does she seem so to me."
Then the king, at the summit of his felicity, exclaims,
"Dress thyself again in thy royal robes, and place thyself
by my side; thou hast been, and shalt always be, my
wife, my only wife; this, my supposed bride, is thy
daughter, and this handsome youth is thy son." The
poor heroine had undergone the last proof of her virtue,
and triumphed.</p>

<p>But the virtue of the legendary heroine is not always
so sound. Often the good wife, sister, maiden, or woman
is corrupted by contact with the wicked. We have
already seen how the beautiful aurora, the pitying and
beneficent maiden, becomes, in the Vedic hymns themselves,
the evil-doer, whom the god Indras overthrows
and destroys. The Hellenic Amazons, the beautiful and
proud warrior-women, were also pursued, fought with,
and vanquished by the Hellenic heroes. Thus the Scandinavian
warrior, Walkiries, has a double aspect, a good
and a bad. The Russian stories also supply numerous
instances of the ease with which the good degenerates into
the demon, the hero into the monster, and the beautiful
heroine into the powerful and mischief-working witch.</p>

<p>This good sister Helen or Little Helen, so careful a
guardian of her brother John, ends, when she conceives a
passion for the monster, with becoming his perfidious
persecutor. (The evening aurora is represented as a
friend of the monster of night, who conspires with him
against her brother the sun; and whoever observes the
sinister aspect often assumed by the reddish sky of
evening, will find this fiction a very natural one. I have
said above that a Piedmontese proverb predicts bad
weather for the morrow from a red evening; but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Piedmont the belief is also widely diffused that the red
of evening signifies blood, and that this bloody redness
signifies war. It certainly does mean war, but a
mythical war&mdash;the war in which the hero, fighting against
the monster, succumbs and sheds blood. It is a woman
that is the hero's destruction. A counter-type of the
biblical Delilah is found in all the popular Indo-European
traditions; the Vedic aurora, the sister of Râva&#7751;as in the
<i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, the sister of Hidimbas in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,
the Hellenic Dejanira, Ariadne, Medea, the Amazons,
Helen, the Slavonic Helen, and Anna the Sabine woman,
the Scandinavian Walkiries, Freya, Idun, Brünhilt,
Gudrun, the Germanic Krîmhilt, are all forms of one and
the same heroine, conceived now in the light of a saint,
and now in that of a witch.</p>

<p>In the Russian story,<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> after the bull has saved from the
bear the fugitive brother and sister, Ivan Tzarevi&#263; and
Helen the exceedingly beautiful (Prekraçna), they enter
a brigand's house. Their bull, having become a dwarf,
kills all the brigands, and shuts their bodies up in a room,
which he forbids Helen to enter; the latter, not attending
to the prohibition, enters, and seeing the head of the
brigand chief, falls in love with him, resuscitates him by
means of the water of life, and then conspires with him
to destroy her brother Ivan, by requiring him to accomplish
enterprises in which death seemed inevitable, or else
by ordering him to bring her, first, the milk of a wolf,
then that of a she-bear, and then that of a lioness. Ivan,
by the help of his dwarf (or the sun grown small during
the night, and perhaps also the moon), accomplishes all
these undertakings. We have already seen how white
comes from black; the milk of the wolf, the bear, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the lioness is the <i>alba luna</i>, or the white morning sky
brought back by the solar hero. Ivan is then sent to
fetch the eggs of the burning bird (Szar-ptitza). Ivan
goes with his dwarf (that is to say, the moon, or he
makes himself a dwarf, in other words, renders himself
invisible); the bird is enraged, and swallows the dwarf
(<i>i.e.</i>, the red sky of evening, the burning bird, or ph&#339;nix,
absorbs the moon or the sun in its flames.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>) Ivan goes
back to his sister without the eggs, upon which she
threatens to burn him in the bath. Ivan, with the help
of the wolf's, the bear's, and the lion's whelps, or Ivan,
with the young wolf, bear, or lion (the moon), or Ivan
the son of the wolf, Ivan the son of the bear, Ivan the son
of the lion (Ivan born of the she-wolf Night, the she-bear
Night, or the lioness Night), tears the brigand to pieces,
and binds his sister (as the Vedic cow) to a tree (the aurora
almost always loses herself in a tree or the water). Then
Ivan wishes to marry a heroine. [Two myths are here
united in the story, originating in one and the same phenomenon,
which seems twofold, because observed at different,
almost literally succeeding, instants. The morning sun
comes and puts to flight his sister the aurora, driving her
back into the forest of night, and binding her to the tree;
the morning sun passes safe and sound through the flames
(like Sîfrit in the <i>Nibelungen</i>), vanquishes and subdues the
aurora, makes her his, and espouses her.] He fights with
her first, and succeeds in throwing her with his lance from
her horse, and subduing her. The first night&mdash;that is,
when evening comes, she embraces and presses him so
tightly, and with such strength, that he cannot succeed
in extricating himself (the evening aurora envelops and
surrounds the sun; it is the famous nuptial belt, the belt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
of strength of the god Thor, the shirt of Nessus). At last,
however, towards morning, Ivan vanquishes, subdues, and
throws down (like Sîfrit in the <i>Nibelungen</i>) the girl-heroine
(the morning sun, as Indras, throws down the aurora). He
then thinks of liberating his sister Helen, who is bound
to the tree, in order to take her with him; but she, under
the pretext of combing his hair, thrusts a dead man's
tooth into his head. Ivan is about to die. Here the
primary myth of the sun and aurora, as brother and sister,
reappears, and the secondary one of the husband and wife
is forgotten. The lion's whelp comes forward and extracts
the tooth; the lion is on the point of dying, when
the young bear runs up and extracts it again. He is also
about to die; the fox then comes up, who assumes
towards the end of the story the part played in the
middle by the young wolf (in the same way as in Indian
tales the jackal is substituted for the fox), and, with more
cunning, throws the dead man's tooth into the fire, and
thus saves himself&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the solar hero, passing through
the flames, comes out of the shadows which enveloped
him during the night. Helen is attached to the tail of a
horse (of Ivan's solar horse itself), and is thus made to
perish (when the sun comes forth in the morning the
aurora loses herself behind him).</p>

<p>The same story of Ivan's perfidious sister, of which the
mythical sense appears to me more than usually evident,
occurs again in other forms in Russian tales.</p>

<p>Whilst Ivan is travelling with his sister towards the
kingdom where all the people die<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> (that is, towards the
night), a fairy gives him a towel, by shaking which a
bridge may be thrown across a river&mdash;(is this bridge the
milky way, the bridge or road to be taken by the souls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
in the Persian and Porphyrian belief, as well as in the
German?)&mdash;but advises him never to let his sister see
him shake it. Ivan arrives with his sister in the kingdom
of the dead; they come upon a river on the further bank
of which there is a serpent, who has the power of transforming
himself into a handsome youth; Ivan's sister
becomes enamoured of him, and he induces her to steal
the towel from her brother and shake it. The sister,
under the pretext of washing the dirty linen, takes off the
fairy's towel and shakes it; a bridge rises, upon which
the serpent crosses the river, and then conspires with the
girl with intent to work Ivan's ruin. They demand the
usual milk, which Ivan brings; then the flour which is
shut up within twelve doors. Ivan goes thither with his
beasts of prey, takes the flour and brings it away, but his
beasts remain shut up inside; then his strength diminishes,
and the serpent, boasting that he fears him no longer,
prepares to devour him. Ivan, by the advice of a crow,
prays for time, and procrastinates till his beasts of prey,
gnawing the twelve doors through, come to his help, and
tear the serpent in pieces. The serpent's bones are
burned in the fire, its ashes are dispersed to the four
winds, and the sister is bound to a stone pillar (to the
rock or mountain upon which the aurora arises, fading
away afterwards when the sun appears). Ivan places
near her some hay and a vessel full of water, that she
may have whereof to eat and drink, and another empty
vessel, which she is to fill with her tears: when she has
eaten the hay, drunk the water, and filled the vessel with
her tears, it will be a sign that God has forgiven her; when
Ivan too will forgive her. Meanwhile, Ivan goes into a
kingdom where there is nothing but mourning, because a
twelve-headed serpent is massacring all the people (the
usual nocturnal sky, where it is now the hero-sun, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the heroine aurora that sacrifices itself), and the king's
daughter is the next victim. Ivan, by the help of his
hunting animals, cuts the serpent to pieces, and then goes
to sleep on the knees of the king's daughter. While he
sleeps, a water-carrier passes towards morning, cuts off
his head, and presents himself to the king as the deliverer
of the princess, whom he demands for his wife. The
beasts of prey come up, descry the crow upon Ivan's
corpse, and prepare to eat it, when the crow begs for its
life; they consent, and in return require it to search for
the water of life and death, by means of which Ivan is
resuscitated; the water-carrier's deceit is found out, and
Ivan marries the princess whom he had delivered from
the monster. Then he goes to look for his sister, and
finds she has eaten the hay, drunk the water, and filled
half the vessel with tears; upon this he pardons her, and
takes her away with him.</p>

<p>In another story,<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> instead of the perfidious sister, we
have the perfidious mother (probably step-mother), who,
to please her demon lover, feigns illness, and demands
from Ivan the heart, first of the three-headed, then of
the six-headed, and finally of the twelve-headed monster.
Ivan accomplishes these undertakings. He is then sent
to a hot bath, to weaken his strength. Ivan goes, and
his head is cut off by the monster. But Ivan's two sons
resuscitate him by rubbing a root upon his body; the
demon lover of Ivan's mother dies as soon as the hero
revives again. In the two sons of Ivan we recognise again
the myth of the Açvinâu, the celestial physicians who resuscitate
the solar hero.</p>

<p>In another story, Ivan Karolievi&#263; (king's son) is threatened
with death by his own wife,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> who, feigning illness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>demands the usual milk of a she-wolf, a she-bear, and a
lioness, and then the enchanted powder (powder of gold
or flour), which is under the devils mill, barred behind
twelve doors. Ivan comes out, but his beasts remain
inside. He returns and finds his wife with the serpent,
the son of the serpent; he chaunts the song of death&mdash;he
sings it three times;<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> on hearing which the serpent is
thrown down, and the beasts, regaining strength to deliver
themselves, come out and tear the serpent, and with him
the perfidious wife is put to death.</p>

<p>Ivan's perfidious wife occurs again in the thirty-fifth
story of the fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>, under the name of
Anna the very beautiful (Prekraçnaia). She has married
Ivan Tzarevi&#263; against her will, because she could not solve
a riddle which he proposed to her; she does not love him,
and endeavours to destroy him by requiring an extraordinary
proof of his valour,<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> in which, by the help of his
tutor, Katoma, Ivan is victorious, so that Anna falls into
his hands. But, understanding that Ivan's strength is not
in himself, but his tutor, she induces Ivan to send him
away, after depriving him of his feet. Anna then sends
Ivan to take the cows to pasture. The lame Katoma
finds in the forest a blind man, also made so by Anna;<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
they become friends and consociate together, and carry off
a beautiful maiden to be their sister; but a witch comes
and makes the maiden comb her hair, whilst she sucks her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>breast (we must remember that in the Indian story the
girl has three breasts, or is defective in her breast, in the
same way as the witch makes the Russian girl so by
sucking her breast). The poor girl grows thin and ugly,
until the old witch is surprised in her evil doings by the
two heroes, fallen upon by them like a mountain of stone,
and pressed so tightly that she cries for mercy. Then
they demand to be shown where the fountain of life and
healing can be found. The old woman conducts them
into a dense forest, and shows them a fountain. They
first throw a dry twig in, which immediately takes fire;
they threaten to kill the old witch, and force her to lead
them to another fountain, into which they throw another
dry twig; it becomes green again. Then one rubs his
eyes, and the other his feet, with the water, and both
become healthy and strong again. They throw the witch
into the fountain of fire. Katoma, in a shepherd's dress,
goes to deliver the hero Ivan from the demon cow, which
lifts up its tail and gives him back his strength and
splendour. This is again the Vedic myth of the Açvinâu
united to the aurora, who cure the blind and the lame,
<i>i.e.</i>, themselves, and save the multiform solar hero.</p>

<p>Finally, such as we have found the blind girl in the
Vedic hymns, so we meet her again in Russian tradition.<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
A servant-maid takes out the eyes of the
maiden her mistress, after having put her to sleep by
means of a herb, and marries the king in her stead.
The girl awakens, hears but does not see; an old
shepherd receives her into his house; during the night
she, although blind, sews a crown for the Tzar and sends
the old man to court to sell it for an eye (this is a
variation of Queen Berta in the forest). The servant-maid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
now become queen, tempted by the beauty of this
crown, takes one of the girls eyes out of her pocket and
gives it to the old man. The maiden arises at the
aurora, washes her eye in her own saliva (<i>i.e.</i>, the dew.
In Tuscany, the peasants believe that whoever washes
his face in the dew before the sun rises on St John's
Day, will have no illness all the year following), puts it
in the socket and sees. She then sews another crown,
and, in the same manner, recovers her other eye at the
next aurora. Then the servant-queen learns that she is
alive, and makes hired murderers cut her to pieces.
Where the maiden is buried, a garden arises and a boy
shows himself. The boy goes to the palace and runs
after the queen, making such a din that she is obliged,
in order to silence him, to give him the girl's heart,
which she had kept hidden. The boy then runs off
contented; the king follows him, and finds himself
before the resuscitated maiden. He marries her, and
the servant-girl is blinded, and then torn to pieces by
being fastened to the tails of horses. Like the German
Geneviève and the Hindoo Çakuntalâ, the Russian wife
is recognised by her husband by means of a boy. This
is the young sun, who enables the old one to be born
again, to arise again and be young once more; this is the
son who, in the Hindoo legend, gives his father his eyesight
back, and by doing so, naturally imparts to him the means
of recognising his wife, whom he had forgotten, or rejected,
or lost, according to the various forms assumed by the
celestial myth of the separation of husband and wife.</p>

<p>I might now carry on this comparison by entering the
mythical field of the more Western Slavonic nations;<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
but it is not my intention to convert this modest volume
into an entire library of legends; neither is it necessary
for my purpose, as by so doing I should not add much
more evidence to that which I have thus far attempted
to collect, in order to prove how zoological mythology is
the same in existing Slavonic tradition as it was in
Hindoo antiquity. I have, moreover, gone rather minutely
into the contents of Russian tradition in particular,
because, on account of our ignorance of the language,
which is beautiful and worthy of study, it is little
known, and because it is of especial importance in our
present inquiry. I believe, if I do not deceive myself,
that I have, up to this point, given an account of all the
more essential legends developed in the Eastern Aryan
world relating to the myth of the cow and the bull; and
now, in moving towards the West, I think I may venture
to proceed with greater expedition, because we shall find
ourselves in a region already familiar to us. It seemed
to me that it was especially necessary, for a just comparison,
to determine and fix the character of Oriental
tradition, in order that it may be easy for the student to
classify the interminable stories and traditions which
have already been collected in Western Europe, and
which are published in languages which are, certainly,
different from each other, but all, comparatively speaking,
readily accessible. If I have succeeded in imparting to the
reader an understanding of the more authentic sources of
legendary traditions and their most probable meanings, I
shall go on with more courage and a greater confidence
to the investigations that follow.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall here combine under one category the Germanico-Scandinavian
and Franco-Celtic traditions, as traditions
which, in the Middle Ages especially, had a close and
continual correlation of correspondence with each other.</p>

<p>The <i>Edda</i> of Snorri begins with the voyage of Gefion,
with the four oxen, her sons (although she is a virgin),
yoked to a plough. The king Gylfi concedes to her the
right of occupying and possessing as much ground as she
can plough in twenty-four hours. When they come to
the western sea-board, the four oxen rush forward and
drag Gefion with them into the sea, until they arrive at
the land of Seelund (Seeland).<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> In which, it is obvious
we have again the Vedic bull with a thousand horns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
which comes out of the sea, and the bull which carries
off the maiden. The bull which comes out of the sea is
also found in Irish legends, and in German ones.
According to a German legend, of which several variations
exist, a shepherd received a dinner every day and
a clean shirt every Sunday from a variegated bull that
came out of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> A bull on the seaside begets, by
the sleeping queen, the king Meroveus, the first of the
Merovingians; perhaps it is on this account that we find
a golden bull's head represented on the tomb of King
Childeric. Charles Simrock<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> found a similar legend also
in Spain. The bull which carries the girl, which we
have already met with in the Russian stories, occurs
again in the Norse tale<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> of "<i>Katee Wooden Cloak</i>
(Dasent), endowed with the powers of wish. In its left
ear is a cloth (which reminds us of that spun on the
cow's horns), which, when spread out, is covered with
dainties of all kinds for the dawn-maiden, who has been
thrust out of her father's house; but when the step-mother
informs her that she cannot rest until she has
eaten the dun bull's flesh, the animal, hearing her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>engages to deliver her, and offers, if she so wills, to carry
her away."</p>

<p>In the voyage of Gylfi in the <i>Edda</i> of Snorri, we find
that the cow Audhumla, the cow of abundance, was the
parent of the supreme Scandinavian god Odin, as it was
of the supreme Vedic god Indras. The cow Audhumla
nourishes with her milk Ymir, the first of the giants.
She licks the salt mountain of ice (the Esthonian ice-mountain,
the twelve glasses of the Russian princess,
through which the young hero Ivan penetrates to kiss
her). From the ice which the cow has licked, comes
forth, first the hair, then the head, then the whole body,
of the hero Buri. (The sun arises little by little from the
mountain of the east, warmed, attracted by the cow-aurora,
and shows, first a few rays, then his disc, and
then himself in all his splendour and strength; and that
which the sun does every day he repeats on a larger
scale once a year, rising again from the ice of winter
through the tepidity of spring.) Of Buri, who is at
birth strong, is born Bör, who has, by Bestla, the
daughter of the giant Bölthorn, three sons, Odin, Wili,
and We (the usual three brothers of the legends), who
correspond to the three sons of Mannus in German
tradition, that is, Inguis, Istio, and Irminius. The
Swedish king Eistein had a great veneration for the cow
Sibilia, and used to take her with him to battle, that she
might terrify the enemy by her lowing. (The lowing of
cows plays an important part in the battles of the Vedic
hero Indras. In the <i>Pa&#324;&#263;atantram</i>, as we have noticed,
the bellowing of the bull fills the lion with terror.) The
Scandinavian king, Ögwaldr, was accompanied everywhere
by a sacred cow, of which he drank the milk, and
with which he desired to be buried. In the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>,
as we have seen, the hero Indras makes the cow fruitful;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and the thunderbolt of the god, penetrating the cloud,
takes the form of a phallos. Afterwards, as a symbol of
the rod-phallos, the branch or rod of the tree palâças was
adopted, with which the cow was struck to make it
fruitful; such a magic rod is used in Germany to this
day, where it is in many parts the custom to strike the
cow, in the belief that it will render her fruitful.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p>It is with the head of the most beautiful of the giant
Hymir's oxen fastened to his hook that, in Snorri's <i>Edda</i>,
the god Thor goes to fish up the immense serpent of
Midgard from the bottom of the sea, and destroys it upon
the sea-shore. (This myth, if I am not mistaken, has the
following meaning:&mdash;The head of the solar, or lunar,
bull is devoured by the monster of night; this same
head, tossed about, draws up, towards morning as sun,
and towards evening as moon, upon the shore of the sea
of night, that is to say, on the eastern mountain, the
monster-serpent: thus Hanumant, in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,
passes over to the opposite shore of the sea, crossing the
body of the marine monster, which he causes to burst;
thus Indras kills Ahis the serpent upon the mountain).</p>

<p>Nor is there the cow of abundance only. Scandinavian
tradition, in the short poem on the dwarf Allwis, offers
us the cornucopia in the cup formed of the defence of
oxen (<i>i.e.</i>, with their horns), in which the god Thor
drinks hydromel. Thus Sigurd offers to Brünhilt a horn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
full of mead to drink. And this horn, moreover, besides
serving as a cornucopia, becomes as a golden horn the
war-trumpet of Odin (the Giallarhorn).</p>

<p>The Scandinavian hero then, it appears also, has his
relationship with cows, though his life has far more of a
warlike character than a pastoral one; he therefore
accuses Loki, and in so doing fills him with shame, with
having passed eight winters underground occupied in
milking the cows like a woman. (It is known that the
Hindoo word <i>duhitar</i>, whence Tochter, means she who
milks). The Scandinavian hero, instead of milking cows,
eats bulls. We find more than once in the <i>Eddas</i> the
heroes occupied in roasting oxen. Atli, the husband of
Gudrun, boasts of having killed some oxen and having
eaten them with her. Gudrun, the Scandinavian Medea,
gives Atli the hearts of his two sons to eat, assuring
him that they are calves' hearts. The god Thor, disguised
as the goddess Freya, drinks three barrels of mead,
and eats a whole bull, when he sets out on the enterprise
of recovering his marvellous hammer. The bull's or
cow's horn, moreover, not only supplies mead to the
hero, nor is it only used to call his friends to his aid
and to throw down the enemy; it also forms the hero's
bow, which therefore, in the <i>Vilkina Saga</i>,<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> also takes
the name of Hornboge, and, as such, assists the greatest
hero, Thidrek or Dîtrich, and is the parent of the celebrated
hero Sigurd (Sîfrit, or Siegfried). And, in conclusion,
the horns are considered such an important
weapon of the cow and bull, that a proverb, which is at
once Slavonic, German, and Italian, says, "To a wicked
cow, God gives short horns" (that it may do no harm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
or rather, because it wears them away by use); to cut
off the cow's horns means, in a German proverb, to surmount
a difficulty; and to take the bull or cow by the
horns, is to disarm them.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>In the Greenland poem on Atli, in the <i>Edda</i> of
Sömund, Högni says, that when many cattle are killed
much blood is seen, and that when one dreams of eagles,
oxen are not far distant. In the <i>Edda</i> of Snorri, whilst
Odin, Loki, and Hönir are cooking an ox under a tree,
an eagle on its summit prevents the meat from being
cooked, till the heroes consent to give him part of it.
The heroes consent, but the eagle carries off no less than
the two thighs and the two shoulders of the ox. The
eagle has in the <i>Edda</i> the same demoniacal and infernal
character that is in other traditions ascribed to the crow,
the funereal stork, and the vulture: it searches for oxen;
and therefore to dream of eagles is an intimation that
an ox is near, in the same way as they say the presence
of a vulture is a sign of the proximity of a corpse.</p>

<p>A German legend, cited by Kuhn and Schwartz,<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>
makes a battle begin "as soon as a red cow is led over a
certain bridge." We remember the Russian story of the
girl who, by means of the magical towel of her brother,
makes a bridge arise over the river, over which the
monster-serpent, in the form of a handsome young man,
crosses to take her; how the brother is sacrificed in the
battle which he is obliged to fight against the monster,
who disarms him by fraud; and how the battle between
the hero and the monster begins when the maiden, passing
the bridge, abandons the hero, her brother, who falls
and sheds his blood in the unequal struggle. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>already remarked that in the popular belief the bloody
sun of evening forebodes war, and the red cow of
German tradition represents no other than this sky. As
to the bridge, an interesting note of Kuhn and Schwartz<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
seems to confirm the hypothesis which I have already
hinted at in connection with the Slavonic story, <i>i.e.</i>, that
it represents the milky way; from this note, too, in which
a resemblance is noticed between the bridge of the red
cow, which determines the beginning of a battle, and
the Scandinavian celestial Bîfröst (as perhaps there is
between it and even the Persian bridge &#262;invant itself),
I gather that in Frisia the milky way is called Kau-pat
(or Kuh-pfad, cow's-path). That is to say, it is supposed
that the red cow of evening passes during the
night along the milky way, scattering her milk over it;
whence perhaps is derived the German proverb, "Even
red cows yield white milk,"<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a>&mdash;like that other which we
have already seen current in India, and met with again
in Turanian tradition, and which exists as a German,
Slavonic, and Italian proverb, "Even the black cow
yields white milk"&mdash;(the black night which produces the
alba or white dawn of morning, and we might add, the
silver moon and the milky way).</p>

<p>Since it seems to me, therefore, as I trust it also
does to the reader, that the maiden who crosses the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>bridge in the Slavonic stories is, without doubt, the same
as the red cow which does the like in German legend,
and if I have not been mistaken in identifying the
maiden who travels with her brother to the kingdom of
the dead with the evening aurora and the dying sun, I
shall here adduce a few other German proverbs, which
may also be said to be universal in European tradition,
relating to the cow, all pointing to a similar conclusion.
They are as follows:&mdash;"Shutting the stable after the cow
has been stolen." "He who has lost a cow, and recovers
her tail, has not much, but he has more than nothing."
"A cow's tail might reach heaven, if it were only a long
one."<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> "A cow does not know what her tail is worth
till she loses it." "To take the cow by her tail." "The
black cow has crushed him, or has got upon him." "A
cow cannot overtake a hare." "The cow has outrun the

<p>Meditating upon all these German proverbs, it is, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>appears to me, not difficult to recognise in them a reminiscence
of ancient myths with which we are already
acquainted. When we reflect that almost every proverb
has passed into contradictory forms and varieties, and as
in these varieties we may trace the elements of the
history of a great number of strange proverbs, it does not
seem rash to affirm that the said history generally had,
in like manner, its origin in a myth. Not to wander
from the subject in hand, that the same proverb is
attributed to different animals, not only by different
nations, but in the oral traditions of the same people, I
must refer the reader to what I have remarked in the preface
to this volume concerning the contradiction which
exists between certain superstitious beliefs. The contradiction
between many proverbs, as also between many
superstitions, compared with each other, can only be
reconciled by referring both back to the battle-field of
mythology, where an inconceivable number of myths
arise, and can only arise, out of contradictions; that is,
out of contrasted aspects which celestial phenomena
present, even to the same observer, still more so to
different observers. The comparative history of mythical
proverbs is yet to be written, and perhaps it is not yet
possible to write it according to rigorous scientific method
in all its completeness. A preliminary study of the
details is necessary to understand a proverb as well as a
popular custom, a superstitious belief, a legend, or a
myth; and this study will demand some labour; for one
proverb, completely illustrated, may involve the development
of an entire epical history. I shall not presume
here to solve the enigma of the above-quoted German
proverbs, but only to indicate what seems to me to be
the way of arriving at their most probable solution. In
the study of a proverb, it is necessary to lay great stress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
upon its intonation. Upon the different tones in which
an ancient proverb was originally pronounced, and afterwards
repeated, passing from tongue to tongue, and from
people to people, depends a great part of the alteration
in the meaning even of the most interesting of the
proverbs, which are a patrimony we owe in common to
Aryan tradition. A proverb, for instance, began by
being a simple affirmation, the simple expression of a
natural mythical image; with the lapse of time the
expression remained, and the myth was forgotten; the
expression then appeared to refer to a strange thing, and
was accompanied, when pronounced, with a doubtful
mark of interrogation; it was now adopted in the denial
of an impossible thing, and became an instrument for
satire. Thus many proverbs which have become satirical,
must have been originally nothing more than mythical
affirmative phrases.</p>

<p>"To shut the stable after the cow has been stolen."
In England, instead of the cow, we have in the proverb
a girl: "When your daughter is stolen, shut Peppergate"
(the name of a little gate of the city of Chester, which
it is said the mayor ordered to be shut when his
daughter had been carried off). The proverb is now
used to stir up a laugh at the expense of those who are
at pains to guard their property after it has been robbed;
but it perhaps had not always the same meaning. We
are already familiar in Hindoo tradition with the hero
who delivers the beautiful maiden out of the enclosure,
and have seen how she is scarcely free, when she is led
away by iniquitous brothers or companions, after shutting
up the legitimate proprietor of the cow or maiden in the
cave whence the cow or girl came forth; how the
ravishing brothers shut the door of the stable or cavern,
after having carried off the maiden. The hero imprisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
in the stable, the hero shut up in the darkness
of night, often assumed in mythology the form of a fool.
Hence from the idea of shutting the gate of the stable
upon the hero, by the ravishers of his cow, the transition
seems natural, in my opinion, to the hero lost in the
cavern, to the hero become foolish, to the peasant who
shuts the door of the stable when the cow has been
robbed, or to the mayor of Chester, who, being shut up
in the town, shuts the Peppergate, through which the
girl who had been carried off passed.</p>

<p>"He who has lost a cow and recovers its tail
has not much, but he has more than nothing." This
proverb also appears to me to have a mythical meaning.
I have already remarked that the tail, the heel, the feet,
that is to say, the lower or hinder extremities, betray the
mythical animal; which we shall see more convincingly
when we come to examine the legends which refer to the
wolf, the fox, and the serpent. It is the footprint which,
in all the European traditions, betrays the beautiful
maiden in her flight; and when the brigand Cacus
carried off the oxen of Hercules, the hero, to recover
them, searches for their footprints. But in order that
these may not be recognised, the cunning brigand, instead
of leading the oxen by their heads, takes them by
their tails,<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> and makes them walk backwards. Hence, to
take by the tail, means to take hold of the wrong way,
and it is applied to the ass as well as the cow. It is
said in Germany that a cow once fell into a ditch from
which none of the bystanders dared to extricate it.
The peasant to whom the cow belonged came up, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
according to some, took it fearlessly by the horns, while,
according to others, he dragged it out by its tail, whence
can be explained the double proverb to take by the horns,
<i>i.e.</i>, to take by the right side, and to take by the tail,
or, as we have said, to take by the wrong. But the
peasant could only take his cow out by the horns, or by
the tail, according to the way in which it had fallen in;
that is, if it had fallen down head foremost, it could
only be dragged out by the tail, and if, on the contrary,
it had fallen in tail foremost, he could only extricate it
by laying hold of its horns. The cow-aurora is taken
by surprise and devoured by the wolf, bear, wild-boar,
or serpent of night, who takes her by the shoulders (it
is on this account that, in the Russian story, we have seen
the bull recommend the fugitive hero, accompanied by
his sister, to keep his face turned in the direction whence
the pursuing monster might be expected to come up).
The monster (the shadow, or the cloud) clutches the cow
by her tail and devours her, or drags her into his cave.
The hero, in order to deliver his cow out of the cave, can
take her by the horns only on condition that he penetrates
into the cavern by the same way by which the cow
entered, that is, by the monster's mouth; but, as the
monster endeavours to surprise the hero from behind, so
the hero often wounds the monster from behind, catches
hold of him by the tail, and in this way drags him out of
the cavern, ditch, or mud&mdash;his fallen cow. In a Hindoo
fable in the second book of the <i>Pa&#324;&#263;atantram</i>, we have the
story of a jackal, who, to satisfy a desire of his wife, follows
the bull for whole years together, in the hope that his
two hanging testicles might fall some day or another.
In a joke of Poggius, and in Lessing,<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> we find the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
subject spoken of, of which a variation is given in a German
proverb, "Though the cow's tail moves, it does not
fall."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> In the hope of this it is that the wolf, or the fox,
runs after the tail of the cow or bull. There is a Piedmontese
story which I heard in my infancy, one comic feature
of which lingers vividly in the memory: a boy who took
the hogs to pasture, cut off their tails and stuck them in
the mud, and then made off with the animals. The
owner of the hogs, seeing their tails, is under the impression
that they have sunk into the mud. He tugs at
them, brings away their tails, but cannot fish up their
bodies. In a Russian story given by <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> we
read that the cunning Little Thomas (Thomka, Fomka)
cheats the priest of his horse (in some versions his ass) by
cutting off its tail and planting it in the mud of a
marsh. He makes the priest believe that his horse has
fallen into the marsh; the priest, thinking to pull it out,
gives one stiff tug, and falls down on his back with the
tail in his hand; upon which Tom persuades him to
believe that he has broken it off himself, and to be
content with the recovery of so much of the lost animal.
In the fifty-seventh Gaelic story of Campbell,<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> a priest
endeavours to pull out of the water a drowning sheep,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>but the tail comes away, and the story-teller adds, "If
the tail had not come off, the story would have been
longer." And so the owner of the cow, the robber of
which has left the tail behind as a consolation, has in
reality but little, but yet this little is something; for,
just as the slipper left behind her by the fugitive girl,
although it is of little value, enables the hero to identify
her, so in the tail of his cow the owner has something in
hand to set out on its search with, and to recover his
lost property; either because the tail of an animal is like
its shadow and serves to trace it, as the slipper does the
maiden by showing the footstep; or else, because tailless
cows are evidently stolen ones. (In the myth of Cacus,
in which Hercules traces the stolen oxen by the footprints,
and Cacus drags them by their tails, the mythical
figure of the slipper and that of the lost tail are perhaps
united. It is possible that the tails of the oxen came off
in the hands of Cacus when dragging them into the
cavern, and that, thrown away by the brigand, and
found by Hercules, they may have served him as a guide
to recover his oxen. It is also possible that Cacus,
pursued by Hercules, had not time to drive the oxen in
entirely, but that their tails still protruded and betrayed
their whereabouts. Relative to the Latin legend of
Cacus, these are simply hypotheses, and I have therefore
enclosed them in a parenthesis; but inasmuch as in the
above-quoted Russian story, we find the horse's tail cut
off by the robber, and as in the chapter on the fox, we
shall see the fox who betrays himself by not drawing in
his tail, whence the proverb, "Cauda de vulpe testatur,"
the two hypotheses advanced above are, after all, not so
visionary.) In <i>Pausanias</i><a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> the hero Aristomenes, who
has been thrown into a deep cistern, liberates himself in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
marvellous manner by means of an eagle, after a fox had
opened a passage. The fox's tail has such a bewitching
power of attraction, that according to popular tradition,
when it is moved the cock falls down unable to resist the
charm. According to popular belief, the tail (as well as the
nose and mouth) is the most splendid part of the body of an
animal. The great monkey Hanumant, with his tail on
fire, burns Lanka (in the same way as the burning tails
of the foxes of the biblical Samson burn the ripe harvests
of the Philistines). The grey, or black, horse of
mythology (having devoured the solar white, or red
horse) emits fire from his mouth or tail. This black
horse being the night, the horse's jaws and tail, which
emit fire, represent the luminous heavens of evening and
of morning; when, therefore, the tail of his horse (stolen
by the robber in the same way as the bull and the cow<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>)
remains in the mythical hero's hand, this light-streaming
tail is enough to enable him to find the whole animal,
<i>i.e.</i>, the solar hero comes out of his hiding-place
(Hanumant comes out of the hinder parts of the marine
monster, the dwarf comes out of the wolf's back<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>), the
bull-sun finds his cow the aurora again; the prince sun,
the princess aurora; the peasant recovers his ass or his
cow; Hercules, his oxen; the white horse comes out of
the tail of the black horse, who had eaten him, and then,
by means of the tail, ascends to heaven;<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> the white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>bull comes out of the black one; the white, or the red,
cow comes out of the black cow; the tail comes out of
the body; the hero comes out of the sack, or hide, in
which he had been enclosed or sewed up. The sack plays
a great part in the tradition of the hidden or persecuted
hero; this sack is the night or the cloud, or the winter;
the hero shut up in the sack, and thrown into the sea, is
the sun. The hero enclosed in the sack and thrown into
the sea, and the heroine shut up in a chest (covered,
moreover, with a cow's hide, in the myth of Pasiphäe) or
barrel, and abandoned to the water,<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> are equivalent to
each other, and so are the heroes shut up in the well, in the
cavern, in the stables, and even in the cow. Inasmuch
as the sack in which, according to the proverb quoted
above, the delinquent hero is to be sewed, is an old cow's-hide,
or else the hide of an old cow, or a dark one (of the
night), when this black cow sits on the eggs of the bird
of evening, to hatch them, the eggs come to evil; whence
I derive the German proverb, "When the cow sits upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
eggs, do not expect fowls."<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> And when the night was
observed to overwhelm the sun and withdraw him from
human sight, this other proverb took its origin, "The
black cow has crushed him." The black cow does not only
crush the hero, but, as the wolf does, shuts him up in
her own hide,<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> in her own sack, <i>i.e.</i>, devours him&mdash;to fill
the sack is the same as to fill the body, and to empty
the sack as to empty the body. In the Piedmontese
story of the dwarf child (the Norwegian Schmierbock),
whom the wolf<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> encloses in the sack, the dwarf comes
out of the sack while the wolf is emptying his body.
Of two Russian stories given by <i>Afanassieff</i>, which we
shall examine in the chapter on the wolf, one shows us
the wolf who puts the peasant in a sack, and the other
the wolf who puts the dwarf-hero in his body; and
both peasant and dwarf save themselves. The two
variations took their origin in the comparison drawn
between the body and a sack, which, in mythical speech,
are therefore the same thing. The hide of the black
bull, black ox, black or grey horse, or black or grey
wolf, and the sack which wraps up the hero or the devil,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>play a great part in popular Indo-European tradition.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>
From the sack of the funeral stork (the night), in a
Russian story,<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> come forth two young heroes (the
Açvinâu), defeaters of their enemies, who spread out the
tablecloth of abundance (the aurora), and a horse which
drops gold (the sun). The hero shut up in the sack, or
the cow's hide, and thrown into the water, escapes from
shipwreck in the same way as those navigators of the
Chinese sea described in his voyages by Benjamin of
Tudela, who, he says, when shipwrecked, escaped being
swallowed up by the waves by covering themselves with
the whole hide of a cow or an ox; for the eagles, mistaking
them for real, flew to the spot and pouncing upon
them, drew them ashore. The ship with the buffalo's
hide is found again in popular stories. This is evidently
a reminiscence of mythical derivation (from which was,
perhaps, afterwards derived the idea of torture, as in the
famous bull of Phalaris, in which many see a symbol of
the god of the waters, the bull's hide in which the tetrarch
Acarnides, vanquished by Memnon, was sewed up,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> in
antiquity, and, in the Middle Ages, the ox's hide in
which, according to the chronicles, the horrid Duke
of Spalato Euroia orders Paulus Chuporus, prefect of
the Emperor Sigismond, to be sewed, to revenge himself
upon him, because he had, out of contempt, saluted
him by bellowing like an ox). Thus with the Celtic
hero Brian,<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> the pretended fool, who speculates upon
the stupidity of those who are reputed wise. When one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>of these so-called sages, deceived by him, proposes to throw
him into the sea shut up in a sack, he makes another
man take his place by means of a witty invention, as
Goldoni's liar would say, whilst he himself comes back
to the shore with a whole herd of cattle. In the other
Celtic, Slavonic, German, and Italian variations of this
story, the would-be fool begins his fortune-making, in
one version, by putting a few coins into his dead cow's
hide, and then selling it at a very high price as a purse
which will give out money whenever shaken; and in
another, by palming off his ass or horse, persuading the
purchaser, by means of an easy deceit, to believe that it
yields gold and silver, and thus obtaining a high price for
it. With the cow are also connected the two horns, by
blowing into which he causes his wife, who feigns death,
to rise to life again, which horns he thus prevails on his
brothers or companions to buy at a great ransom, who,
thinking themselves cunning, and wishing by means
of the horns to speculate upon corpses,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> begin by killing
people, and are ruined. I have said above, that the sack
in which the hero is generally enclosed is the same as the
chest in which the heroine is usually shut up on account of
her beauty, that is to say, in which the beautiful heroine
hides her splendour, or in which the red cow, the
evening aurora with the sun, loses herself. The fourteenth
Scottish story of Mr J. F. Campbell's contains the following
narrative:&mdash;A king, whose first wife (the morning
aurora) is dead, engages to marry the woman whom
the dead queen's dresses will fit, and finds no one who
can wear them except his own daughter (the evening
aurora). She makes her father give her gold and silver
dresses and shoes (that is, she takes from her father, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
sun, the splendour of the morning aurora); she shuts
herself up with them in a chest, and lets herself be
thrown into the sea. The chest drifts about on the
waves, and comes at last to the shore; the beautiful
maiden enters the service of a young king; she shows
herself in church with her splendid robes; the young
king, who does not recognise his servant-maid in this
beautiful princess, becomes enamoured of her, and
hastens to overtake her; she flees and loses her golden
slipper; the king finds it, and to discover her, has it
measured on every foot; many maidens cut off their
toes to make the slipper go on, but a bird divulges the
deceit; the young king marries the beautiful maiden who
came out of the wooden chest. Here we have again,
not only the heroine who escapes, but the walking
heroine; this heroine is the aurora, and the aurora is
often a cow. Another swift cow passes in the proverb
before the hare (the leaping moon), in the fable of the
ant and the grasshopper, of which the former represents
the cloud or the night, or Indras or the aurora in the
cloud of night, or the earth,<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> and the latter, the leaping one,
the moon; the ant passes the grasshopper in the race, not
because it walks faster, but because the two runners
must necessarily meet, and therefore the one must pass the
other. The English infantile rhyme, "Hey! diddle,
diddle, the cat and the fiddle, the cow jumped over the
moon," refers to the myth of the cow which jumps over
the hare. The observation of celestial phenomena being
afterwards neglected, and it being forgotten that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
running ant or cow meant the cloud, or the sun, or the
aurora, or the earth, and the jumping hare or grasshopper
the moon, only a regular and parallel race, on the terrestrial
soil, between cow and hare, or ant and grasshopper, was
seen; and from the myth of the two animals which meet
and pass each other in the sky, was derived, according to the
different characters of nations or eras, a double proverb&mdash;one
deriding the slow and rash animal which presumes
to try and overtake the swift one in the race, the other
serving as an example to prove the truth of the sentence,
"Tarde sed tute," which, in Italian, is "Chi va piano va
sano e va lontano" (he who goes slowly, goes well and
far). The first proverb has for its parent the Greek one,
"to hunt the hare with an ox," which, in Italian, is
"pigliar la lepre col carro" (to take the hare with a
car);<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> referring to cases where means disproportionate
to the end are made use of. When the hare and the cow
meet, if the cow is obliged to stop the hare, she crushes
it, as we have seen above that she crushes the bird's
eggs instead of hatching them. The idea, moreover, of
the ox hunting the hare arose naturally out of the idea
of the ox or cow overtaking and passing beyond the hare.
To these proverbs can perhaps be joined the next German
one:&mdash;"All who blow the horn do not hunt hares,"
which is now directed against those who think by an
easy method, such as blowing a horn, to accomplish a
difficult enterprise, such as hunting a hare; in the same
way as in Germany it is said, that all thunder-clouds do
not give rain, and the cow must do more than low in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
order to have much milk, or the cow that lows most is
not the one that yields most milk.<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> In fact, a cow
which lows much is unwell, neither while it is lowing
can it eat and make milk; so he who fatigues himself
with blowing the horn is not able, at the same time, to
run after the hare; as in the Italian proverb, "Il can
che abbaia non morde" (the dog that barks does not
bite), for the simple reason that whilst he opens his
mouth to bark, he cannot shut it to bite. The hen that
clucks, on the other hand, is the one that lays the egg,
because the act of clucking with the mouth does not
interfere with the operation of egg-laying; there is no
incompatibility of offices.</p>

<p>The German proverb, "As a blind cow finds a pea," is
now used to indicate an impossibility; and yet in the
myth the blind cow (or the night) really finds the pea,
kidney-bean, or bean (the moon), which are the same
thing to all intents and purposes. The night is sacred
to the dead; for the dead are as eaten vegetables&mdash;kidney-beans,
vetches, peas, and cabbages&mdash;lunar symbols of
resurrection and abundance. In the ninth story of the
fourth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>, the daughter of the old man
and woman eats beans; a bean falls upon the ground, and
grows up to the sky; upon this bean the old man (the sun)
climbs up to heaven and sees everything. In the numerous
stories in which the young hero sells a cow or cow's hide,
we almost always find a pipkin full of kidney-beans,
which he induces people to think can cook themselves,
the hero having first cooked them, and then placed them
upon the fire covered with ashes (the darkness); the
pipkin is also the moon. The stories of the pipkin
belonging to the house-mother in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
which the god K&#7771;ish&#7751;as, having been hospitably entertained
by her, refills with beans, and of the lord who,
in an unpublished Piedmontese legend, disguised as a
poor old man, throws pebbles into the kettle of the pious
widow, which, as soon as thrown in, become kidney-beans,
involve the same myth. In the same way I think
the kidney-bean is evidently intended by the fruit of
fruits, which, according to the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, the
merciful man receives in exchange for the little black
cow (<i>k&#7771;ish&#7751;adhenukâ</i>) given to the priest.<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> In the
English fairy tale of "Jack and the Bean-stalk," Jack
barters his cow for some beans; his mother (the blind
cow) scatters the beans; one of them takes root, and
grows up to the sky.<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> By means of the black cow, of
the funereal or blind cow, of the cow-aurora, which
becomes black or blind during the night, the hero finds
the bean or the pea of abundance (the moon), by means
of which he sees again in the morning and becomes rich.</p>

<p>We have seen a sack, instead of the hide of a black
cow, used to signify the night; in like manner, after or
instead of this same cow's hide (which the hero goes to
sell), as well as the pea or bean, we have the pipkin&mdash;the
poor hero finds the moon. The Slavonic story of the
potter who becomes rich, and that of the brother believed
to be stupid, who sells at a high price his pipkin, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>makes the beans boil without a fire, are varieties of the
same subject. In a Russian story in <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> the
amphora takes the place of the pipkin that makes
its owner rich. The poor brother draws it out of the
water; from the broken amphora comes a duck, which
lays one day golden eggs, and the next silver ones&mdash;the
sun and the moon (at morning the aurora hatches the
golden day, at evening the silver night).</p>

<p>We have still to explain the proverbs of the cow that
laughs and the cow that spins. The laughing aurora
(after having, during the night, acted the princess that
never laughs) and the spinning aurora (in relation with the
cow, the moon, that spins by means of its horns) are
already known to us. The aurora laughs at morn in the
sky, at the sight of her husband; thus the princess that
never laughs, in a numerous series of Slavonic, German,
and Italian stories, laughs when she sees her predestined
husband.<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> The proverb of the cow that laughs is connected
with that of the cow that speaks; it is perhaps
on this account that bulls and cows (and other animals)
which speak, and say and do complimentary things
among themselves, in an entire cycle of Indo-European
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>stories, which have been learnedly illustrated by Professor
Benfey, in <i>Orient und Occident</i>, under the title of
"Ein Märchen von der Thiersprachen," always make the
man who understands, and indiscreetly listens to their
language, laugh. But if the man reveals what the bulls
or cows (or other animals) have said to each other, he
prepares his own ruin: the language and the inner life
of animals must not be divulged to all; if published
abroad, the augury is a sinister one. That which makes
the princess of the Russian tale laugh, is seeing the
courtesy which the animals, like men, show to the man
taken out of the mud; that which makes the man who
understands the language of animals laugh, is seeing
them speak and act to each other exactly as men do in
similar private relations. To betray this mystery is to
wish for one's death. No one must know what the bull
said in secret to the cow, the sun to his mistress, what
the king said in the queen's ear. The violator of the
mysteries of Venus is guilty of sacrilege, and merits the
punishment of death, or at least brings evil down upon
his head. Woe to the heroine if the hero hidden in the
skin of an animal, on account of some indiscretion, or because
she has spoken to her sisters, shows himself naked
in his human form; she loses him, and their separation
is inevitable.</p>

<p>We are already acquainted with the cloud-cow and the
cloud-bull; the cloud thunders, the bull bellows and
speaks. The clouds, the Vedic <i>gnâ devapatnîs</i>, <i>gnâ devîs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
that is, the goddesses, or divine and knowing wives, the
fairy goddesses (women with their presentiments, the
women that know more than the devil), are also prophetic
cows; these cows, in their character of fairies, speak with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
a human voice, and so do the cloud-bulls. Hence the
Romans could take their auguries from an ox that spoke
with a human voice. It has been said that this omen was
a sinister one, but it is a mistake. According to Livy,
under the consulate of Cn. Domitius and L. Quintius, an
ox threw Rome into terror by the words, <i>Cave tibi, Roma</i>.
These words seem to have a sinister meaning, but they
are in reality nothing more than a friendly counsel or
admonition, as much as to say, Look to your field occupations,
O Rome; the thunder has been heard which announces
the summer. Thus, when we read in the fifth
book of Pliny's <i>Natural History</i> that whenever an ox was
known to have spoken with a man's voice, the Roman
Senate was accustomed to meet in the open air&mdash;<i>sub dio</i>, I
only see in this allusion, and in ascribing this practice to
the Senate, one way of saying that when thunder is heard
(that is to say, when the ox speaks) it is a sign of summer,
and we may go out into the country and sleep in the open
air. And so, finally, when, according to Eusebius, an ox
said, that for the death of Cæsar (which, as every one knows,
took place on the Ides of March, that is to say, at the beginning
of spring) there would be more blades of corn than
men, I see a most evident announcement of the approach
of summer, in which men or reapers are in fact never too
many, and even rare when the harvest is a large one.
The ox that with a man's voice heralds the near advent of
summer corresponds to the cuckoo, the legend of which
we shall reserve for a special chapter. Meanwhile, to
confirm still more our identification, we shall cite here
the almost proverbial verse of Theocritos: Women know
everything, even how Zeus married Hêra (or that which
the king said in the queen's ear). Zeus, transformed into
a cuckoo, flew to the mountain, and alighted on the knees
of Hêra, who, to protect him from the cold, covered him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
over with her robes. The cuckoo, or Zeus, disappears
soon after having spoken, that is, announced the summer
loves of the sun. After St John's Day the cuckoo, who
appears in March, is no longer seen; so the ox, soon
after it has spoken and betrayed the loves of Zeus, or soon
after the cloud has thundered, revealing the secret loves
of the sun within the sky covered with clouds, or the
confidential speeches and secret caresses of the animals,
pays for this indiscretion by his own death. As the
aurora is represented in the Vedic hymns by a maiden
who does not laugh, and smiles only when she sees her
husband,<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> so the lightning that tears the cloud and comes
before the thunder is compared to the laughing of an ox
or a cow, or else of the man who has seen their loves.
As long as the sky only lightens, or merely smiles,<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> there
is little harm done. No one can know as yet why the ox
or the cow, the hero or heroine, or the third person who
is looking on, smiles before the spectator; but when the
hero or the heroine speaks, betraying the thought or
singular surprise which makes him or her smile, the
penalty of the indiscretion is death; the thundering cloud
is soon dissolved into rain. Nor will my identification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>of the cloud that lightens (making a distinction between
the lightning and the thunderbolt) with the smiling cow, or
ox, or man who, understanding the language of animals,
as they speak in low tones, and seeing their most familiar
habits, smiles, seem forced when we reflect that our
language has preserved the figures of a ray of joy, of a
flash of joy, to indicate a smile, of which we say that it
shines, illumines, or lightens. Lightning is the cloud's
smile. In the ninth story of the third book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,
we meet with a fish which laughs in the face of the
onlooker (the cloud that lightens, and also the moon that
comes out of the ocean of night), and for which, on account
of this singular property, the poor man (the sun in
the cloud or in the night) obtains an extraordinary sum
from a rich lord, even all his riches&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the poor man
takes the place of the lord; the splendid sun takes the
place of the sun hidden in the cloud or in the darkness.
In a Hindoo story of <i>Somadevas</i> (i. 5), a fish laughs upon
seeing men disguised as women in the king's apartment.
In the <i>Tuti-Name</i> (ii. 21), the fishes laugh when they see
the prudery of an adulteress. With this is connected the
fable of Lafontane, "Le Rieur et les Poissons" (viii. 8).
In the legend of Merlin, the magician also laughs because
the wife of Julius Cæsar lives with twelve heroes disguised
as women, and because he himself allowed himself
to be taken by Grisandole, a princess disguised as a
cavalier.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p>The fish is a phallic symbol (in the Neapolitan dialect,
<i>pesce</i>, fish, is the phallos itself). The fish that laughs because
it has been the spectator of adultery is the phallos
itself <i>in gaudio Veneris</i>. The thunderbolt of Indras is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
his phallos that breaks the cloud. In Ovid,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> we have
Jupiter, who, by means of riddles, teaches Numa the way
of forming the thunderbolt.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The joke of the April fish (le poisson d'Avril), with
which so many of our ladies ingenuously amuse themselves,
has a scandalously phallical signification.<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> The
fishes of the Zodiac are twins, a male and a female bound
together, born of Erôs (Amor) and Aphroditê (Venus).
In the Adiparvam of the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, we read of a
fish which devours a man's seed, and a girl who, having
eaten it, brings forth a child. The same myth occurs
again in the Western popular tales.</p>

<p>The cow that spins still remains to be explained. We
have already seen that the cow spins with her horns for
the maiden; this cow is, generally, the moon, which
spins gold and silver during the night. The aurora is
ordered by her step-mother, the night, both to pasture
the cow (the moon) and spin. If the cow-maid is to take
care of her cow and guard her well, she will be able to
spin but little; whence the German proverb is right
when it says that if the cow-maid must spin there will
be little yarn. The good cow-maid prefers to keep her cow
well, and pays every regard to it, in order that it may
find good pasturage; then the grateful cow (the moon)
puts gold and silver upon its horns to spin for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>maiden.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> In the morning the girl appears upon the
mountain with the gold and silver yarn, with the gold
and silver robes given her by the good fairy or by the
good cow.<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> And when the old woman kills the cow,
the girl who keeps its bones and sows them in the
garden sees, instead of the cow, an apple-tree with gold
and silver apples grow up, by offering one of which to
a young prince the maiden obtains a husband, whilst
perverse women are beaten by the apple-tree or find
themselves opposed by horns. This apple-legend is a
variation of the star which falls upon the good maiden's
forehead on the mountain, and of the horns, or donkey's
tail, which grow out of the forehead of the bad
sister who has maltreated the cow or badly combed the
Madonna's head. The story of the good maiden and the
wicked one, of the beautiful and the ugly one, finishes
with the attempt made by the ugly and wicked girl to
take the place of the beautiful and good one in her
husband's bed, in the same way as, in other stories, a
black washerwoman tries to take the place of the
beautiful princess; and this conclusion brings us to the
interesting story of the spinning Berta, or Queen Bertha,
as she is called.</p>

<p>In German mythology we have the luminous Berchta,
who spins, in contrast with the dark and wild Holda at the
fountain (the washerwoman of fairy tales). The former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>seems to be (besides the moon as a white woman, in her
period of light, the silvery night) the aurora, the spring,
or the luminous aspect of the heavens; the latter (besides
the moon in her period of darkness, Proserpina or Persephonê
in hell), the dark night, winter, the old witch.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>
The same name is given to the various phenomena of the
gloomy sky, in the same way as a contrary name is given
to the various phenomena of the luminous heavens. On
this account lunar and solar myths, daily and annual
myths, enter into the story of Berta or Berchta.</p>

<p>Berta, like the cow of the fairy tales, spins silver and
gold. Therefore, when we say in Italy that the time
when Berta spun is past,<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> this expression means, that
the golden age, the age in which gold abounded is past.
And instead of this expression we also use another in
Italy to denote an incident which took place in a very
ancient era, at a time very remote from the memory of
men; we say, in the times of King Pipino (Pepin).
Queen Berta having been the wife of Pepin, it was
natural that the times of the husband should correspond
to the fabled era of his wife, who was, tradition alleges,
mother of Charlemagne, the hero so-named of the
legends, of whom it is said, in Turpin's Chronicle, that
he had long feet, and his <i>alter ego</i> Orlando (a new and
splendid mediæval form of the twin heroes), rather than
of the King Charlemagne of history.</p>

<p>Berta has a large foot, like the goddess Freya, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>German Venus, who has swan's feet. It is this large
foot that distinguishes her from other women, and
enables her husband to recognise her, in the same way
as it is the foot, or footprint (the sun follows the path
taken by the aurora), that betrays and discovers the
fugitive maiden, who, we have said, is the aurora with the
vast chariot (the vast chariot which, if it pass over the
hare, may crush it. Frau Stempe, and Frau Trempe, and
the large-footed Bertha, are the same person)&mdash;vast,
because she occupies a large extent of the heavens when
she appears. When standing on the chariot, she seems to
have no feet, or a very small, an imperceptible foot; but
the chariot on which she stands and which represents
her foot is so much the larger; therefore when we leave
the chariot out of account, and suppose, on the contrary,
that she goes on foot, inasmuch as, when walking, she
takes up much room, the swan's, or goose's, or duck's
foot given to her in the myth of Freya and the legend of
Berta is quite suited to her. And seeing, as we have
said, that the foot (the myths almost always speak of
one foot alone; even the devil is lame, or has only one
foot) and the tail of an animal are often substituted for
each other in mythology, we can understand how, in a
Russian story,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> the hero who has fallen into a marsh was
able to deliver himself by clutching hold of the tail of a
duck. This duck being the aurora, and having a wide
spreading tail as well as a large foot, the solar hero, or
the sun, can easily, by holding on to her, raise himself
out of the swamp of night. There is a German story<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>which the white woman, or the Berta, is transformed
into a duck. In another German legend,<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> instead of the
swan-footed Berta, we have the Virgin Mary (who, as a
maiden, represents the virgin aurora, always pure, even
after having given birth to the sun; like the Kuntî of the
<i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, who gives birth to Kar&#7751;as, the child of
the sun, and yet is still a virgin. On the other hand,
when a good old woman, good woman or Madonna, she
generally personifies, in the legends, the moon) who, in
the shape of a swan, comes to deliver from the prison of
the infidels (the Saracens or Turks, here the black
demons, or the darkness of night), and carry off by land
and by sea, the young hero whom she protects (the
aurora delivers the sun from the night).<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> The same
luminous Berta also assumes, in popular German tradition,
the form of St Lucia, that is, the saint who, after
having been made blind, became the protectress of eyesight.
Of the blind or black cow of night is born the
luminous cow of morning, the aurora that sees everything
herself and makes us see everything. For the
same reason that the cow or duck, Berta, is consecrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>to St Lucia, whose appearance she assumes, the bull (the
sun) is sacred to St Luke, the festival of whom is on
this account celebrated at Charlton, near London, with a
horn-fair or exhibition of horns, generally ornamented
and perfumed.</p>

<p>In the above-quoted Hindoo legend of the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,
the queen will not sleep with the old blind man,
but sends instead her servant-maid. In the <i>Reali di
Francia</i>, King Pepin is advised by his barons to take a
wife, when he is already "far advanced in years" (he is
a form of St Joseph). The barons look for a wife, and
find, in Hungary, Berta, the daughter of King Philip,
"the most beautiful and skilful horsewoman," or Berta
with the large foot upon a beautiful and stately horse,
which goes along the road bounding, whilst she is always
laughing. Berta has a maid called Elizabeth, who resembles
her in every respect except her feet. King
Pepin is married by proxy to Berta, sends for her, and
comes to meet her. Berta when she sees that King
Pepin is so ill-favoured, grieves "although forewarned of
his old age." When evening comes she takes off her
royal robes and gives them to Elizabeth, that she may
take her place and sleep with the king.<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> Hence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
Italian proverbs, "Dar la Berta" (to give the Berta),
and "Pigliar la Berta" (to take the Berta), meaning to
deride and to be derided. But instead of to give the
Berta, in Italy we also say, "Dar la madre d'Orlando"
(to give the mother of Orlando). The <i>Reali di Francia</i>
informs us that King Pepin had, by Elizabeth, two perverse
bastards, Lanfroi and Olderigi, and by Berta,
Charlemagne and another Berta, mother of Orlando; but
the Italian proverb is perhaps nearer the mythical truth
when it recognises the mother of Orlando as herself
Pepin's wife, so that Charlemagne and Orlando are
brothers; and, in fact, they accomplish several of the
undertakings mentioned in the legend of the two
brothers. In the so-called Chronicle of Turpin<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> when
Orlando dies, Charlemagne says that Orlando was his
right arm, and he has no longer anything to do in life
without him; but he lives long enough to avenge the
death of Orlando; and after this vengeance, the heroic life
of Charlemagne comes at once to an end. In the <i>Chanson
de Roland</i>, too, after the death of his hero, whom he
avenges, Charlemagne feels the burden of life, weeps,
tears his beard, unable to support this solitude; but in
the <i>Chanson</i>, as well as in the <i>Reali di Francia</i>, Orlando
explicitly appears as the nephew of Charlemagne, that is,
as the son of his sister Berta. (As the Vedic aurora was
now the mother, now the sister of the sun and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
Açvinâu, thus Berta may, mythically, be mother or
sister of Charlemagne, and yet be always the mother of
Orlando).</p>

<p>It would be a never-ending work to collect together
all the Germanic, Scandinavian, and Celtic legends which,
in one way or another, are connected with the myth of
the cow and of the bull. The literature relating to this
subject is composed not of one or a hundred, but of
thousands of volumes, of which some (such, for instance,
as the poem of the <i>Nibelungen</i>, and the poems of the
<i>Round Table</i>) individually contain, in the germ, almost
the whole diverse world of fairy tales. I must therefore
limit myself to the indication of the more general
features, leaving to more diligent investigators the
minuter comparisons; and esteeming myself, I repeat,
too happy if my brief notices should be found clear
enough to spare others the labour of preparing the warp
upon which to weave comparisons.</p>

<p>From what we have said thus far, it seems to me that
two essential particulars have been made clear:&mdash;1st,
That the worship of the bull and the cow was wide-spread,
even in northern nations; 2d, That the mythical
bull and cow were easily transformed into a hero and
heroine.</p>

<p>The sacred character ascribed to the cow and the bull
is further evidenced by a Scandinavian song, in which,
on the occasion of the nuptials of the animals (the crow
and the crane), the calf (perhaps the bull) appears as a
priest, and reads a beautiful text.<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> As a symbol of
generation, the bull is the best adapted to propitiate the
married couple; so the priest in the <i>Atharvavedas</i> teaches
the inexperienced husband and wife, by formulas <i>ad hoc</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the mysteries of Venus. Thus the <i>jus primæ noctis</i> was
conceded to the Brahman in mediæval India; and so in
the ritual of mediæval France, we still find indications
of the priest <i>pronubus</i>. The beautiful text that the calf,
or bull, recites in the Scandinavian song must be the
same which, according to the ceremonial recorded by
Villemarqué, the priest recited, whilst sprinkling them
with incense, to the married couple <i>sedentes vel jacentes
in lectulo suo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> Thus, when the wolf dies (in a German
writing of the twelfth century), it is the ox that reads
the gospel.<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> Besides marriages and funerals, the bull or
ox also appears, finally, as in the Hindoo ceremonial, in
pregnancy. Gargamelle, while she has Gargantua in her
womb, eats an excessive quantity<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> of tripe of fattened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>oxen. When she feels the pains of child-birth, her
husband comforts her with an agricultural proverb of
Poitou, "Laissez faire aux quatre beufz de devant;"
and she then gives birth to Gargantua, who comes out
of her left ear, in the same way as in the Slavonic stories
we find the heroes come out of the ears of the horse (or
of the ass of night; the luminous solar hero comes out
of the ears of the ass, or of the grey or black horse; the
twin horsemen come out of the two ears). Rabelais, to
explain this extraordinary birth, asks "Minerve ne naquit-elle
pas du cerveau par l'aureille de Iupiter?" No
sooner is Gargantua born, than he asks with loud cries
for something to drink; to give him milk, 17,913 cows
are brought, his mother's breasts not being enough,
although each time she is milked she yields "quatorze
cens deux pipes neuf potées de laict." This is the giant
of popular tradition, whom the gigantic phantasy of
Rabelais has coloured in order to make him the butt of
an immense satire. It is an amplified and humorous
rendering in a literary form of the popular Superlatif,<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>
whose mythical character is revealed in the curse hurled
against him by the old dwarf-fairy, whom he maltreated:
"One sun, to accomplish his work, eats eleven entire
moons; but this time every moon will eat the work of a
sun." The ascending and descending life of the solar
hero is thus indicated. Superlatif will become continually
smaller, until it seems as though he were about
to disappear altogether; but at that very instant the
curse comes to an end, and from a dwarf, he grows into
a giant again in the arms of his bride.<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> Thus the days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>become continually shorter and shorter, till the winter
solstice, till Christmas. At Christmas the sun is born
again, the days lengthen, the dwarf grows tall; the sun,
by a double but analogous conception of ideas, passes
once each day and once each year from giant to dwarf,
and from dwarf to giant.</p>

<p>And the dwarfs of tradition know and reveal the
mythical how and why of their transformations, since,
though they are dwarfs and hidden, they see all and
learn all. It is from the knowing dwarf Allwis, his
diminutive <i>alter ego</i>, that the mighty Thor, in the <i>Edda</i>,
learns the names of the moon, the sun, the clouds, and
the winds. The moon, according to Allwis, when it is
in the kingdom of hell (in the kingdom of death, in the
infernal world, when it is Proserpina), is called a wheel
that is hurrying on; it then shines among the dwarfs
(<i>i.e.</i>, in the luminous night, in which the sun hides itself;
it becomes an invisible dwarf). The sun among the
dwarfs (<i>i.e.</i>, when it is a dwarf) plays with Dwalin (the
mythical stag, probably the horned moon); among the
giants (<i>i.e.</i>, when in the aurora, it becomes a giant
again), it is a burning brand; among the gods (the Ases),
it is the light of the world. The cloud, the dwarf Allwis
goes on to inform us, is the ship of the winds, the strength
of the winds, the helmet (or hat, or hood) which makes
its wearer invisible. The wind, again, is the wanderer,
the noisy one, the weeper, the bellower, the whistler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
(no one can resist the cries or the whistling of the hero
of fairy tales; the bellowing of the bull makes the lion
tremble in his cave). In this learned lesson on
Germanico-Scandinavian mythology, given us by the
dwarf Allwis, we have a further justification of the
transition which we here assume to have been made
from the natural celestial phenomenon to its personification
in an animal, and to the personification of the
animal in a man: Allwis, who knew all things, has
explained the mystery to us.</p>

<p>In descending now from the North upon the Hellenic
and Latin soils, to search for the mythical and legendary
forms assumed there by the bull and the cow, the mass
of available material in point which offers, instead of
diminishing, has increased prodigiously. Not to speak
of the rich literary traditions of mediæval Italy and
Spain (as to those of France, they are often but an echo
of the Celtic and Germanic), nor the significant traditions
of the Latin historians and poets themselves, nor
the beliefs, superstitious customs, and legends still existing
on the half-Catholic, half-Pagan soil of Italy, all of
which are notably fraught with the earliest mythical
ideas, we here find ourselves face to face with the colossal
and splendid edifice of Greek poetry or mythology
itself; for that which constitutes the greatness and real
originality of Greek poetry is its mythology, by means of
which it is that a divinity breathes in every artistic work
of Hellenic genius. The poet and the artist are almost
always in direct correspondence with the deities, and
therefore it is that they so often assume such a divine and
inspired expression. It would, therefore, be a bold presumption
on my part if I were to essay to extract and
present, in a few pages, the soul, the contents of this
endless mythology. I have, moreover, the good fortune
of being able to plead relief from the obligation to venture
on any such attempt, by referring the reader to the learned
preparatory works published in England, in the same interest,
by Max Müller and George Cox, upon the Hellenic
myths in relation to the other mythologies. It is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
possible to take exception to interpretations of
particular myths proposed by these two eminent scholars,
as, no doubt, might be the fate of many of mine, were I
to enter into minute explanations, and were my lucubrations
fortunate enough to obtain any measure of consideration.
But as I flatter myself with the hope that,
notwithstanding occasional diversions, in which I may
have gone aside and lost myself for a few minutes, I
am taking the royal road which alone leads to the solution
of the great questions of comparative mythology,
I recognise with gratitude the labours of Max Müller and
Cox upon Greek mythology, the writings of Michael
Bréal upon Roman mythology, the immortal work of
Adalbert Kuhn upon the Indo-European myth of fire
and water, and a few other helpful beacon-towers which
send their light-shafts clear and steady athwart the
waste, and serve as useful guides to the studious navigator
of the <i>mare magnum</i> of the myths. And because
that which there is yet to do is immense in proportion to
the little that has been done well, I shall take for granted
what has already been demonstrated by my learned
predecessors (to one and all of whom I confidently and
respectfully refer my readers), and go on with my own
researches, restricting myself, however, entirely to the
zoological field, in order not to increase, out of all proportion,
the dimensions of this opening chapter, which
already threatens to straiten the space I must leave for
the rest of my undertaking.</p>

<span class="i0">"Bos quoque formosa est,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>says Ovid, in the first book of the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, when
the daughter of Inachos is transformed into a luminous
cow by Jupiter. The bull Zeus of Nonnos is also
beautiful, as he swims on the sea, carrying the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
maiden Eurôpê. Her brothers wonder why oxen wish to
marry women; but we shall not wonder when we remark
that Iô and Eurôpê are duplicates of one and the same
animal, or, at least, that Iô and Eurôpê both took the
shape of a cow&mdash;one as the moon especially,<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> the other,
the far-observing daughter of Telephaessa, the far-shining,<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>
as the moon also, or the aurora. In the first
case it is the heroine that becomes a cow; in the second,
it is the hero who shows himself in the shape of a bull.<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>
These forms are, however, only provisional and unnatural,
in the same way as in the Vedic hymns the representation
of the aurora, the moon, and the sun as cow and
bull is only a passing one. The cow and the bull send
their calf before them; the sun, the moon, and the aurora
are preceded or followed by the twilight. Jupiter and
Minerva have for their messenger the winged Mercurius;
and hence also Ovid<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> was able to sing:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>The fruit of the nuptials of Iô and of Eurôpê with
Zeus is of a monstrous nature, such as the evil-doing
daughters of Danaos, who, on account of their crimes, are
condemned in hell to fill the famous barrel (the cloud)
that is ever emptying (the counterpart of the cup which,
in the Scandinavian myth, is never emptied); such too
as Minôs, he who ordered the labyrinth to be made, the
infernal judge, the feeder of the Minôtauros (of which
the monstrous bull of Marathon, first subdued by
Hêraklês and afterwards killed by Theseus, is a later
form), the son of his wife and the gloomy and watery
black bull Poseidôn. Even Kadmos, the brother of
Eurôpê, ends his life badly. He descends into the kingdom
of the dead in the form of a serpent. Of good, evil
is born, and of evil, good; of the beautiful, the hideous,
and of the hideous, the beautiful; of light, darkness, and
of darkness, light; of day, night, and of night, day; of
heat, cold, and of cold, heat. Each day and each year
the monotonous antithesis is renewed; the serpent's head
always finds and bites its tail again. A Tarentine verse
of Arnobius expresses very happily these celestial vicissitudes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Taurus draconem genuit et taurum draco."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus, in the romance of Heliodoros (<i>Aithiopika</i>) we read
that the queen of Ethiopia, being black, gave birth to a
white son; that is to say, the black night gives birth to
the white moon and to the white dawn of morning. To
Zeus (Dyâus, the luminous,) are sacrificed white bulls;
to his brother Poseidôn, black ones; indeed, entirely
black<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> ones, according to the Homeric expression.</p>

<p>Poseidôn, in Hesiod (<i>Theog.</i> 453), is the eldest brother;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
in Homer (<i>Il.</i> xv. 187), he is, on the contrary, the
youngest; and both are right; it is the question of the
egg and the hen; which is born first, darkness or light?
The son of Poseidôn, Polyphêmos the Cyclop, is blinded
by Odysseus. Poseidôn, representing the watery, cloudy,
or nocturnal sky, his one-eyed son seems to be that sky
itself, with the solar star, the eye of the heavens, in the
midst of the darkness or of the clouds (the mouth of the
barrel). When Odysseus blinds his son, Poseidôn avenges
him by condemning Odysseus to wander on the waters
(that is, lost in the ocean or the clouds of night).
Inasmuch, moreover, as Zeus, properly the luminous one,
is often called and represented by Homer as black as the
clouds and pluvial,<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> he is assimilated to Poseidôn, the
<i>presbýtatos</i> or oldest; in fact, in the oldest Hellenic
myths, Poseidôn is essentially the pluvial form of Zeus.
When Poseidôn, in the form of a bull, seduces Pasiphaê,
the daughter of the sun and wife of Minôs, he appears,
indeed, of a white colour, but has between his horns a
black spot.<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> This spot, however small, is enough to
betray his tenebrous nature. Thus Acheloos, vanquished
by Hêraklês in the shape of a serpent, rises again in that
of a pugnacious bull, one of whose horns Hêraklês
breaks,<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> which he gives to the Ætolians, who receive
abundance from it (the waters of the Acheloos fertilise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>the country traversed by them; the dragon of the cloud
kept back the waters; Hêraklês discomfits the dragon,
<i>i.e.</i>, the darkness, and it then reappears in the form of a
bull; when its horns are broken, abundance is the consequence).
This monster reappears in the two perverse
and terrible bulls of King Aiêtas, with copper feet (<i>taurô
chalkópode</i>), which breathe dark-red flames and smoke,
and advance against the hero Iêsôn in the cavern; in
the same way as the king of the monkeys in the
<i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> vanquishes the demoniacal bull that fights
with its horns, by taking hold of the horns themselves,
and throwing it down; so Iêsôn does in Apollônios.<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
The same bull is repeated in that ridden by the youth
Ampelos, dear to Diónysos (who has also the nature of a
bull, <i>taurophüsês</i>, but of a luminous one). Ampelos, persuaded
by the death-bringing Atê (<i>thanatêphóros Atê</i>),
mounts on this bull, and is thrown by it upon a rock
where his skull is broken, because he was full of pride
against the horned moon, her who agitates the oxen, who,
offended, sends a gadfly to the bull and maddens it.
The bull Diónysos wishes to avenge the young Ampelos,
by fixing his horns in the belly of the perverse and
homicidal bull.<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> In this myth, the black bull of night
and the bull-moon are confounded together in one
sinister action.</p>

<p>From the ocean of night comes forth the head of the
solar and lunar bull, and on this account, in Euripides<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
Okeanos is called the bull-headed (<i>taurókranos</i>); or else
the head of the solar bull enters the nocturnal forest, or
that of the lunar bull comes out of it. This phenomenon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>gave rise to several poetical images. The bull is devoured
by the monsters of night; hence in the <i>Seven at Thebes</i>
(xlii.) of Æschylos, the messenger accuses of impiety the
seven eaters of bulls, who touch with their hands the
blood of bulls; hence in the forty-third fable of Æsop,
the dogs flee, horrified, from the peasant who, being of a
gluttonous nature (like the old man of the Russian story
who eats all his cows), after having devoured sheep and
goats, prepares to eat the working oxen themselves.<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
The bulls head, or even the bull itself, or the milch-cow,
which must not be eaten, can, however, be sacrificed;
nay, he is lucky who offers them up (except when the
deity is named Heliogabalus, who receives the <i>taurobolium</i>
as a homage due to him, without giving anything in
exchange to the devoted sacrificers).<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> According to
Valerius Maximus,<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> the empire of the world would, by
an oracle of the time of Servius Tullius, belong to the
nation who should sacrifice to the Diana of the Aventine
a certain wonderful cow belonging to a Sabine (the aurora
or the moon, from the sacrifice of which the sun comes out
at morning). The Sabine prepares to sacrifice it, but a
Roman priest takes it from him by fraud, whilst the
Sabine is sent to purify himself in the water near at
hand. This is a zoological form of the epico-mythic rape
of the Sabines, of the exchange of the wife or of the precious
object, of the exchange effected in the sack.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>In Ovid,<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> the same myth occurs again with a variation:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Matre satus Terra, monstrum mirabile, taurus<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Parte sui serpens posteriore fuit.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Milvus; et meritis venit in astra suis."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We shall return to this myth in the following chapters.
The monster is killed only when his heart, which he
keeps shut up, is taken away. Sometimes he does not
keep it shut up in his own body, but in a duck (the
aurora), which comes out of a hare (the moon sacrificed
in the morning).<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> When this duck is opened, a golden
egg (the sun) is found. When the egg is thrown on the
ground, or at the monster's head, the monster dies. The
golden duck, whence the monster's heart, the sun, comes
forth, is the same as the cow which gives birth to the
lamb (the night gives birth to the aurora, and the aurora
to the solar lamb). The historian Flavius cites, among the
prodigies which preceded the destruction of the temple
of Jerusalem, a miracle of this kind, which took place in
the middle of the temple itself, in the case of a cow led
thither to be sacrificed. It occurs still every morning in
the mythical heavens, and was a phenomenon familiar
to human observation in the remotest antiquity, when it
became a proverb; but, as often happened, the proverb
which affirmed an evident myth, when its sense was lost,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>was adopted to indicate an impossibility; wherefore we
read in the second satire (cxxii.) of Juvenal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Scilicet horreres maioraque monstra putares,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Si mulier vitulum, vel si bos ederet agnum?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Greek and Latin authors<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> we find frequent examples
of the sacrifice of a bull a short time before the death
of the hero by whom it was ordered, in which it was
noticed as a very sinister omen that the entrails were
missing, and particularly the heart or the liver. Having
observed that the monster's heart is the solar hero, or the
sun itself, we can easily understand how, in the sacrifice
of a bull, this heart must be wanting when the hero
approaches his end. In the mythical bull sacrificed at
evening, the hero's heart is not to be found; the
monster has eaten his intestines, of which, according
to the legend, he is particularly greedy.</p>

<p>But the bull does not always let himself be sacrificed
patiently; he often flees in order not to be killed. We
have seen in the Russian stories how the bull, which his
owner intends to sacrifice, flees into the forest, with the
lamb (the bull and the lamb are two equivalent forms of
the morning and evening solar hero) and the other
domestic animals. The proverb of Theokritos, "Even
the bull goes into the forest,"<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> can have no other origin
than in the two analogous myths of the moon which
wanders through the forest of night, and of the sun who
hides himself in the same forest, when he sees the preparations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>made for the sacrifice; the sun in the night
becomes the moon.</p>

<p>I have said that the bull, when sacrificed, often, on
account of his being devoid of intestines, forebodes
unlucky occurrences to the hero; the solar bull of the
evening is without strength, he has no heroic entrails.
But after he has been to pasture freely in the forest, after
having exercised his powers in battle with the wolves of
night, after having, by his bellowing (in the darkness,
in the thundering cloud), filled all the animals with
terror, the bull is found again and led towards his
dwelling of the morning, full of light, like a sacrificed
hero; heroic entrails are found in him; from the black
bull who is sacrificed towards morning, from the
forest, from the bull of night, come forth the heart, the
liver, the life and strength, the sun, the hero-sun; and
the human hero, observing his sacrifice, considers it a
good omen. We can thus understand the narrative of
Ammianus Marcellinus: "Decimus (taurus) diffractis
vinculis, lapsus ægre reductus est, et mactatus ominosa
signa monstravit."<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> Whilst he is hidden in the forest,
the solar bull is black, but often (<i>i.e.</i>, in all the nights
illumined by the moon), giving up his place to the moon,
he appears in the form of a white bull or cow, who
guides the hero lost in the darkness. Thoas is called the
king of the Tauroi (or bulls) in the <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i>
of Euripides, because he has wings on his feet. The
cow Iô flees without stopping in the <i>Prometheus</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Æschylos. Euripides<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id="FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> says that she gave birth to the
king of the Kadm&#339;ans. Here, therefore, we find once
more the intimate relation between Iô and Eurôpê, the
sister of Kadmos, which I noticed above. Kadmos, the
brother of Eurôpê, unites himself with Iô. But Iô is a
cow, and we find a cow, a travelling cow, marked with a
white spot in the shape of a full moon (the moon itself,
or Iô), in the legend of Kadmos in B&#339;otia, according to
Pausanias,<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> and to Ovid,<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> who sings&mdash;</p>

<p>This is the good fairy, or good old man, who shows the
way to the heroes in popular tales; it is the cow which
succours the maiden persecuted by her step-mother, the
puppet which spins, sews, and weaves for the maiden
aurora. For just as we have seen that the wooden girl
is the aurora herself, which at morn comes out of, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>even re-enters, the forest of night,<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> as is clearly shown
by the myths of Urvaçî and of Daphne, so in like manner
the moon comes out of and re-enters the nocturnal
forest, transforming herself from a tree to a cow, and
from a cow to a tree, wooden girl, or puppet. Some
myths relating to the aurora are also applicable to the
moon, on account of the resemblance of the phenomena
(the lunar and solar bulls also are interchangeable), as
they both come out of the nocturnal gloom, both drop
dewy humours, and both run after the sun, of which the
aurora is the deliverer in the morning, and the moon the
protectress, guide, hostess, and good advising fairy, who
teaches him the secret by which to avoid the ambuscades
of the monster. Hêraklês passes the sea upon the neck
of the cow-moon; but instead of the cow, we also find
in the mythical sky of Hêraklês the golden cup, which
is the same thing. From the cow-moon comes forth
the horn of abundance; from the cornucopia to the cup
the passage is easy. It is said that Hêraklês, approaching
the oxen of Geryon, the West, felt himself burned by
the sun's rays, and shot arrows at him (in the same way
as Indras in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> breaks a wheel of the car of
Sûryas, the sun). The sun admires the courage and
strength of the hero, and lends him his golden cup,
upon which Hêraklês passes the sea. This being accomplished,
Hêraklês restores the cup to the sun, and finds
the oxen.</p>

<p>The bull which carries the hero and heroine, in the
Russian story, arises again in another form, if its essential
part (now the intestines, now the bones, now the ashes)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
is preserved. The cow which helps the maiden becomes,
as we have already seen, an apple-tree, and helps her
again in this form. We find the same myth transformed
in Greece. In <i>C&#339;lius</i>, quoted by Aldrovandi,<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> we read,
"Cum rustici quidam Herculi Alexicaco bovem essent
immolaturi, isque rupto fune profugisset (the bull destined
to the sacrifice repairs to the forest of night), nec esset
quod sacrificaretur, malum arreptum suppositis quatuor
ramis crurum vice, deinde additis alteris duobus ceu
cornuum loco, bovem utcumque fuisse imitatos, idque
ridiculum simulacrum pro victima sacrificasse Herculi."
This account is confirmed by the facts recorded by Julius
Pollux,<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> that the apple-tree was sacrificed to Hêraklês.
The moon, on account of its circular form, assumed,
besides the figure of a pea, a pumpkin and a cabbage,
also that of a golden apple. As it contains honey, the
sweet apple represents well the ambrosial moon. Moreover,
in the same way as we have seen the pea which fell
on the ground become a tree, and rise to heaven, so the
apple became an apple-tree, the tree of golden apples
found in the Western garden of the Hesperides.</p>

<p>The moon, besides the form of a horned cow, also
assumed, in the popular Âryan belief, that of a tart, of a
cake, either on account of its circular shape, or of the
ambrosial honey supposed to be contained by the moon,
because of the dew or rain which it spreads on the ground.
The cake has in Slavonic tradition the same importance
as the pea, kidney-bean, or cabbage. The bull or cow of
the fool, bartered for a pea, is perhaps the same as the
sun or aurora of evening, bartered during the night for
the moon, or else meeting the moon. The funereal pea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>or kidney-bean, the vegetable which serves as provision
for the journey in the kingdom of the dead, and which
brings the hero riches, is perhaps only the moon, which
the solar hero finds on the way during the night, and
which he receives in exchange for his cow's hide. When
the hero possesses this pea, he is assured of every kind
of good fortune, and can enter or ascend into the luminous
sky, as well as come out of the gloomy hell, into
which the monster has drawn him. A similar virtue is
attributed to the cake, which we find in Indo-European
funeral customs instead of the vegetable of the dead.</p>

<p>After this we can understand what Plutarch tells us in
the Life of Lucullus concerning the Cyziceni, of whom
he writes, that, pressed by siege, they offered up to Proserpine
(the moon in hell) a cow of black paste, not
being able to offer up one of flesh; and he adds, that the
sacrifice was agreeable to the goddess. Thus, in the
thirty-sixth fable of Æsop, we read of an invalid who
promises to the gods that he will sacrifice a hundred
oxen to them in the event of a cure; when cured, as he
does not possess a hundred oxen of flesh, he makes a
hundred of paste, and burns them upon the hearth. But,
according to Æsop, the gods were not satisfied, and
endeavoured to play off a joke upon him; an attempt,
which, however, did not succeed, inasmuch as the
cunning man used it to his own profit; for the solar hero
in the night, not being really a fool, merely feigns to
be one.</p>

<p>But, to return to the cow-moon: we must complete the
explanation of another myth, that of the excrement of
the cow considered as purifying. The moon, as the
aurora, yields ambrosia; it is considered to be a cow; the
urine of this cow is ambrosia or holy water; he who
drinks this water purifies himself, as the ambrosia which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
rains from the lunar ray and the aurora cleans the paths of
the sky, purifies and makes clear (<i>dîrghaya &#263;akshase</i>) the
paths of the sky which the shadows of night darken and
contaminate. The same virtue is attributed, moreover, to
cow's dung, a conception also derived from the cow, and
given to the moon as well as to the morning aurora.
These two cows are conceived as making the earth fruitful
by means of their ambrosial excrements; these excrements,
being also luminous, both those of the moon and
those of the aurora are considered as purifiers. The
ashes of these cows (which their friend the heroine preserves)
are not only ashes, but golden powder or golden
flour (the golden cake occurs again in that flour or
powder of gold which the witch demands from the hero
in Russian stories), which, mixed with excrement, brings
good fortune to the cunning and robber hero. The ashes
of the sacrificed pregnant cow (<i>i.e.</i>, the cow which dies
after having given birth to a calf) were religiously preserved
by the Romans in the temple of Vesta, with
bean-stalks (which are used to fatten the earth sown with
corn), as a means of expiation. Ovid<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> mentions this
rite:&mdash;</p>

<p>The ashes of a cow are preserved both as a symbol of

<p>I have noticed above the myth of Hêraklês, in which,
having passed the sea upon the golden cup, he finds the
oxen upon the shore. These oxen are thus described by
Theokritos, in the myth of King Augeias, as the child
of the sun. The sun, says Theokritos, granted to his
son the honour of being richer than all other men in
herds. All these herds are healthy, and multiply without
limit, always becoming better. Among the bulls, three
hundred have white legs (like the alba of morning), two
hundred are red (like the sun's rays), with curved horns.
These bulls are to be used for purposes of reproduction;
besides them there are twelve sacred to the sun, which
shine like swans. One of them is superior to all the rest
in size, and is called a star, or Phaethôn (the luminous,
an epithet given to Hêlios, the sun, in the <i>Odyssey</i>, the
guider of the chariot of the sun, who, after finishing his
diurnal course, is unable to rein in the horses, and is precipitated
with the chariot into the water, in order that
the burning horses may not set fire to the world. Instead
of solar oxen, which draw the chariot, and fall, at evening,
into the nocturnal marsh, we find in this myth the
chariot drawn by horses overturned into the waves; but
the Phaethôn, the very luminous and excellent ox, as
represented by Theokritos, justifies our identification of
the two mythical episodes of the ox and of the horse
which falls into the water). The bull Phaethôn of
Theokritos sees Hêraklês, and, taking him for a lion,
rushes upon him and endeavours to wound him with his
horns. The sun, as a golden-haired hero, is a very strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
lion (Hêraklês, Samson); as a golden-horned hero, he
is a very strong bull; enclosed in the cloud, they roar
and bellow. The two images of the sun-lion and of the
sun-bull are now in harmony and now in discordance,
and fight with one another. In the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> we
found the two brother-heroes Râmas and Lakshma&#7751;as,
an epic form of the two Açvinâu, represented respectively
as a bull and a lion. In the Hellenic fables we frequently
find the lion and the bull together, and afterwards
in discordance, as happens in the legend of the two
brother-heroes. In Æsop and in Avianus, the bull (perhaps
the moon) fleeing from the lion (<i>i.e.</i>, from the sun in its
monstrous evening or autumnal form of a lion), enters the
hiding-place of the goat (the moon in the grotto of night),
and is insulted and provoked by it. In another Æsopian
fable, on the contrary, it is the lion who fears the horns
of the bull, and induces him to part with them, in order
that the bull may become his prey.<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> In yet another
Æsopian fable taken from Syntipa, the bull kills the lion,
while asleep, with his horns. In Phædrus, the wild boar
with his tusks, the bull with his horns, and the ass with
kicks, put an end to the old and infirm lion. In
Phædrus's fable of the ox and the ass drawing together,
the ox falls inert upon the ground when he loses his
horns. Aristoteles, in the third book on the Parts of
Animals, censures the Momos of Æsop, who laughs at
the bull because he has his horns on his forehead instead
of on his arms, showing that if the bull had his horns on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
any other part of his body, they would be a useless
weight, and would impede his other functions without
aiding him in anything. The ox and the lion were also
painted together in Christian churches.<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>To continue the legend of the solar hero and the oxen,
we find again in Hêraklês, as employed among the herds
in the service of King Augeias, the sun, the usual hostler-hero;
he is not only to guard the herds well, but in one
day to cleanse them thoroughly, and make them shine.
Defrauded of the price by Augeias, he kills him, and
ravages all his country. In the same way, in Homer,
Apollo guards, for a stipulated price, the herds of King
Laomedon upon Mount Ida, and is cheated of his reward.
In the same way, Hermes takes the herds of King
Admetos to pasture; he leads them to browse near the
herds of Apollo, from whom he steals a hundred bulls
and twelve cows, preventing the dogs from barking (as
Hêraklês does when he leads away Geryon's oxen). This
Hermes, this god Mercury, god of merchants, this
merchant and robber, is the same as the skilful and
cunning thief of the stories who carries off horses, draught
oxen, caskets, and ear-rings from the king; he is the
hero-thief; but a shade distinguishes him from the
monster brigand or Vedic demoniacal Pa&#7751;is; the hero
who hides himself and the monster that hides things
both do a furtive action. When Hermes leads away the
herds stolen from the solar god, the sun, he also takes
care to fasten branches of trees to their tails, which, by
sweeping the road, shall destroy the track of the bulls
and cows that have been led away. The shepherd Battos
plays the spy, although, as the price of his silence, Hermes
has promised him a white cow (the moon, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
Battos himself, the spy, is the moon). Hermes tests him,
by disguising himself and promising him a bull and a
cow if he speaks. Battos speaks, and Hermes punishes
him by transforming him into a stone:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"Vertit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In durum silicem, qui nunc quoque dicitur index."<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This god Mercury, who steals the bulls from Apollo
(as Hêraklês leads away the oxen of Geryon), is the
divine form of the thief. His demoniacal form, is&mdash;Cacus,
the son of Vulcan (as the Vedic V&#7771;itras is the son of
Tvash&#7789;ar), who vomits fire; a giant who envelops himself
in darkness, in Virgil; three-headed (like the Vedic
monster), in Propertius;<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> who inhabits in the Aventine
forest a cavern full of human bones (like the monster of
fairy tales); who thunders (flammas ore sonante vomit),
who fights with rocks and trunks of trees, in Ovid<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> (like
the heroes in the Hindoo, Slavonic, German, and Homeric
tradition); who steals the cows from Hêraklês, and hides
their footprints by dragging them backwards into the
cavern, in Livy; who also tells us that the cows in the
cavern low, wishing for the bulls from whom they are
separated (as in the Vedic hymns). The hero, hearing
them, finds the cavern, overturns with a great noise the
rock which five pair of oxen yoked together could
scarcely have moved (like the Marutas who break the
rock, like Indras who splits the crag open), and with the
three-knotted club (trinodis) kills the monster and frees
the cows. The solar hero who at evening leads away
oxen or cows, or who at morning steals them from the
stable, is a skilful robber who has acted meritoriously,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>and marries, in reward, the princess aurora; the cloudy
or gloomy monster who steals the solar cows to shut them
up in the cavern, whence he then throws out smoke and
flames, is an infamous criminal. The divine thief steals
almost out of playfulness, either to show his craftiness or
to prove his valour; the demoniacal thief steals because
of his malevolent character, and instinct to devour what
he steals, as does the fabled worm of the river Indus (the
Vedic Sindhus, or heavenly ocean), who draws into the
abyss and devours the thirsty oxen who go to drink.<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<p>The monster of the clouds who whistles and thunders
only terrifies; the god who whistles and thunders in the
cloud, on the other hand, is <i>par excellence</i> a celestial
musician; his musical instrument, the thunder, astonishes
us by its marvels,<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> and makes stones and plants tremble,
that is, makes stones and plants move, especially celestial
ones (<i>i.e.</i>, cloud-mountains and cloud-trees); it draws
after it the wild animals (of the heavenly forest), tames
and subdues them. The bellowing bull terrifies the lion
himself. We, therefore, also read in Nonnos,<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> that
Dionysos gives a bull in reward to Æagros, who has
won in the competition of song and of the lyre, whilst
he reserves a hirsute he-goat for him who loses; on this
account we find on the capitals of columns in old
Milanese churches, calves and bulls represented as playing
on the lyre.<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> It is a variation of the myth of the
ass and the lyre, which has the same meaning. The bull
and the ass, for the same reason, are found represented
together, because they bellow and bray (like Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>Corybantes) near the cradle of the new-born god, in order
to hide, by their noise, his birth from the old king or
deity who is to be dethroned.<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> The conch of Bhîmas, the
elephant-horn of Orlando, the Greek war-bugle tauraia,
by means of which armies were moved, derived their
character and their name from the mythical bull, the
thundering god. The voice of the bull is compared in
Euripides to the voice of Zeus;<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> the music which pleases
the heroes is certainly not the air of the <i>Casta diva</i>; it is
the braying of the ass,<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> the roar of the lion, the bellowing
of the bull, who occupies the first place in the heavens,
and has occupied us so long, because the supreme god
took his form, after having carried off Eurôpê. Zeus
left on the earth his divine form, and the more generally
preferred heroic form of a bull took him up to heaven:&mdash;</p>

<p>We thus, after a long pilgrimage in the fields of tradition,

<p>The myth of the horse is perhaps not so rich in legends
as that of the bull and the cow, but certainly no less
interesting. As the horseman is the finest type of the
hero, so the horse which carries him is in mythology the
noblest of animals.</p>

<p>We have already observed that the best of the three
brothers, the third, the victorious one, the morning sun,
is, in tradition, distinguished from the other brothers by
his swiftness; and that the morning dawn or aurora,
which is the third sister, the good one, the best of the
three sisters, is she who wins the race. It is, therefore,
natural that the favourite animal of the hero should be
his horse. The two Hindoo Dioscuri, that is, the Açvinâu,
the two horsemen, derive their name from the açvas or
horse, as being the swift one;<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> and they are very probably

<i>Âitareya Brâhmanam</i>, when giving the characteristics of

the aurora by red cows (or bulls), teaches us that Indras
is drawn by horses, and the Açvinâu by asses; the
Açvinâu carried off the prize.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> In the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>
we find another important circumstance, <i>i.e.</i>, the Açvinâu
represented as sons of a mare, or of Tvashtrî, wife of the
sun Savitar, who took the form of a mare. Therefore we
have here the sons of the mare, who may be horses or
mules, according as the mare united herself with a horse
or with an ass. Here, then, we have already an evident
proof of the identification of the heroes Açvinâu with the
animals, horses or asses, which draw them. The <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>
does not as yet know the word <i>açvatara</i>, or mule, but in
representing the Açvinâu drawn now by horses and now
by asses, it shows us the intermediate character of the
real animal that draws the Açvinâu, a grey beast, dark-coloured,
and white only in its fore parts. Night is the
mule that carries the Açvinâu or twilights, in the same
way as, in the above-quoted <i>Âitareya</i>, it carries or
awakens Agnis, fire or light. In the <i>Iliad</i>,<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> mules are
sung of as being better adapted than oxen to draw the
plough.</p>

<p>The hero's horse, like the hero himself, begins by
being ugly, deformed, and inept, and ends by becoming
beautiful, luminous, heroic, and victorious.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>The mythical horse of the Hungarians, the horse Tátos,
or Tátos lo, when born, is of an ugly aspect, defective
and lean; it is therefore said in Hungarian, that "the
Tátos comes out of a defective horse." It is, however,
always born with teeth,<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> although its chin is sometimes
wanting; its bursts out of a black pentagonal egg on an
Ash Wednesday, after the hero has carried it for seven
summers and seven winters under his arm. In the
<i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> the first created horse U&#263;&#263;âi&#7717;çravas,
the king of the horses (and therefore the horse of Indras),
which is as swift as thought, follows the path of the sun,
and is luminous and white, has, however, a black tail,
made so by the magic of the serpents, who have covered
it with black hairs. This is probably the black ass's or
horse's tail which remains upon the ugly or wicked
sister's forehead, in the popular European story of the
two sisters.<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> It must also be remarked that, as the word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span><i>U&#263;&#263;âi&#7717;çravas</i> means, properly, him of the high ears, it
indicates the ass better than the horse.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same way, therefore, as the hero of popular
tales before becoming a wise man is generally an ass, the
animal ridden by the solar hero, prior to being a real and
noble horse, is usually a worthless jade, or a dark-coloured
ass. The sun, in the beginning of the night, rides a
black horse, and afterwards a grey one, or else an ass or a
mule, but in the morning, on the contrary, a white and
luminous horse, which has a black tail; or else the dark
horse of night has a white head, or white legs, or anterior
parts of the body, with golden ears, and the nape of the
neck formed of pearls.<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> The monstrous Trojan horse
too, of Epeios, a figure which represents the horse of
mythology, in Tryphiodôros the Egyptian,<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> has a golden
mane, red eyes, and silver teeth.</p>

<p>In the Turkish stories of Siberia,<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> it is upon an iron-coloured
horse that the third brother, hated by his father
and his two elder brothers, advances against the demon
Ker Iutpa. The hero becomes the excrement of a horse,
and the horse a crow; the former glues the monster's
lower lip to the earth, the latter suspends his upper lip
to the sky. In order better to understand this strange
myth, we must remember that the name of one of the
Valkiries is "Mist," a word which means excrement and
fog. The fog, or frost, or rain, or dew, falls to the ground;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>the solar horse, or the sun, rises in the sky; the monster
of night or of clouds is dispersed.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth Esthonian story of <i>Kreutzwald</i>, the
third brother comes three times to deliver the princess
from the mountain of glass (or ice), where she sleeps.
The first time he is dressed the colour of bronze, upon a
bronze-coloured horse; the second time dressed in silver,
upon a horse the colour of silver; and the third time
upon a gold-coloured horse, dressed in gold.</p>

<p>In an unpublished Piedmontese story, the young prince,
whose beloved princess has been ravished beyond seas,
is borne over the waves by an eagle, which he feeds with
his own flesh. Arrived beyond the sea, he hears that the
princess is destined to be the wife of the hero who wins
the race three times; the first time he appears dressed
in black, upon a black horse; the second time dressed
in white, upon a white horse; and the third time dressed
in red, upon a red horse. Each time he wins the race,
and thereafter receives the beautiful princess in marriage.</p>

<p>Thus we see the first horse of the hero is always dark-coloured,
like the devil's horse, like the horses of Pluto,
which, accustomed to darkness, are terrified by light;<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> it
then becomes the grey horse of the giantess, the grey
horse which smells the dead hero Sigurd in the <i>Edda</i>.
Pêgasos himself, the <i>hieros hippos</i> of Aratos, is born
semi-perfect (êmitelês),<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> an expression which reminds me
of the <i>equus dimidius</i> of an Alsatian paper of 1336, in
Du Cange, by which the mule is meant. The Hindoo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>Aru&#7751;as, charioteer of the sun (or even the brother of the
sun himself, inasmuch as he is the brother of Garu&#7693;as,
the solar bird), is said to be born with an imperfect body;<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
he can be luminous and divine only in part. The black
horse, on the contrary, has generally an evil and demoniacal
nature; the black horse corresponds to the black
devil; the colour black itself is, according to popular
superstition, the product of bad humours.<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> Every horse,
when born, has, according to Maestro Agostino, a piece
of black flesh upon its lips, called hippomanes by the
Greeks: "La quale carne dici lo vulgo essere molto
sospettosa a li maleficii." Maestro Agostino adds, moreover,
that the mother refuses to give suck to the colt as
long as it carries this piece of flesh upon its lips, and
some say that the mother herself eats it. In an idyll of
Theokritos, we read that the Hippomanes is born among
the Arcadians, and maddens colts and swift mares.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> In
the first chapter we mentioned the Russian <i>damavoi</i>, the
demon who, during the night, rides upon cows, oxen,
and horses, and makes them perspire. This superstition
was already combated in Italy in the sixteenth century by
Maestro Agostino;<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> and to it can probably be traced the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>custom, still observed by many grooms, of leaving a lamp
lighted in the stable during the night. The devil, as is
well known, is afraid of the light (Agnis is called rakshohan,
or monster-killer), and his black horse likewise. It
is therefore a sinister omen, according to two verses in
<i>Suidas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> to dream of black horses, whilst, on the contrary,
it is a good omen to dream of white ones. In the Norman
legend of the priest Walchelm, a black horse presents
itself to him in the first days of January of the year 1091,
and tempts him to mount upon its back; scarcely has
Walchelm done so, than the black horse sets off for
hell.<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> The dead, too, according to the popular belief,
often ride upon black or demoniacal horses.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>A well-known Russian story in verse, the <i>Kaniok
Garbunok</i>, or <i>Little Hump-backed Horse</i>, of Jershoff,
commences thus:&mdash;An old man has three sons, the
youngest of which is the usual Ivan Durák, or Ivan the
fool. The old man finds his corn-field devastated every
morning; he wishes to find out who the devastator is,
and sends his first-born son to watch the first night.
The first-born has drunk too much, and falls asleep, and
so does the second son, and from the same cause, on the
second night. On the third night it is Ivan's turn to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>watch; he does not fall asleep. At midnight he sees a
mare which breathes flames coming. Ivan ties her by a
rope, leaps upon her, seizes her by the mane, torments
and subdues her, until the mare, to be let free, promises
to give Ivan one of her young ones, and carries him to
the stable where her three young ones are. She gives
Ivan a little hump-backed horse with long ears (the
Hindoo U&#263;&#263;âi&#7717;sravas), that flies. By means of this little
hump-backed horse, Ivan will make his fortune; when
he leads it away, the mare and the two other colts follow
it. Ivan's two brothers steal the mare and two colts,
and go to sell them to the Sultan. Ivan rejoins them,
and the three brothers stay in the Sultan's service as
grooms; sometime afterwards, Ivan saves himself from
drowning by means of his horse.</p>

<p>In the third of <i>Erlenwein's</i> Russian stories, a stallion
is born to the Tzar's mare, that had drunk the water in
which a certain fish (a pike, in the nineteenth story) had
been washed, at the same time as the Tzar's daughter and
her maid give birth to two heroes, Ivan Tzarevi&#263; and
Ivan Dievi&#263;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, John of the Tzar and John of the girl,
a form representing the Açvinâu. Ivan Tzarevi&#263; rides
upon the stallion. In the nineteenth story, the son of
the mare is called Demetrius of the Tzar (Dmitri Tzarevi&#263;);
hero and horse being identified. In the fifth story of
<i>Erlenwein</i>, a Cossack goes into the forest, where he is betrayed
into the enemy's hands, who gives orders that he be
cut in pieces, put into a sack, and attached to his horse.
The horse starts, and carries him to the house of silver
and gold, where he is resuscitated. During the following
night, an old man and woman, whose guest the Cossack
is, drag him, in order to waken him, by the cross which
hangs on his neck, and he is thus transformed into a horse
of gold and silver. Towards evening, the horse, by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
Tzar's order, is killed, and (like the bull and the cow)
becomes an apple-tree of silver and gold. The apple-tree
is cut down, and becomes a golden duck. The golden
duck is the same as the golden horse, or as the hero resuscitated,
<i>i.e.</i>, the morning sun. The sack and the horse
which carry the hero cut in pieces represent the voyage
of the sun in the gloom of night, or the voyage of the
grey horse, the imperfect horse, the bastard mule, or the
ass.</p>

<p>In the Russian tales, moreover, a distinction is made between
the grey and the black horse; the grey horse helps
the hero in the night very effectively, and the black one,
on the contrary, is the herald of death. When, in the
ninth story of <i>Erlenwein</i>, the horse of Ivan the merchant's
son goes to search for the horses of the princess from
beyond the sea, Ivan waits for him upon the shore. If
he sees grey horses come forth, it is to be a sign that his
own steed is alive; but if, on the other hand, black horses
appear, he is to conclude that his own horse is dead.
Grey is the colour of sadness, black is the colour of death.</p>

<p>In <i>Afanassieff</i>, we find new interesting data. Ivan
the fool watches during the night to surprise the horse
which devastates his father's crops, and succeeds in binding
it with rods from a linden-tree, after it has smelt the
odour of tobacco. Then, by the help of the sister of the
hero Nikanore, it acquires the faculty, when running
after cows and horses, of turning their tails into gold, as
well as their horns or manes, and their flanks into stars.
What better image could there be of the starry sky of
night, the golden tail of which is the red evening, and
the front parts, also of gold, the morning aurora?<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>

<p>In another story,<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> we have Ivan the son of the bitch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>occupying the place and playing the part of Ivan the son
of the mare. Ivan of the bitch, after having delivered
the three princesses from the deep cistern, is himself
thrown into it. The black horse comes to deliver him,
and cannot; the grey horse comes, and cannot either;
the red horse comes, and succeeds in dragging the hero
out. The black horse represents the dark night, the grey
horse the night beginning to clear, and the red horse the
roseate morning, which delivers the sun or solar hero.</p>

<p>The third brother Ivan, mounted on a marvellous
horse, comes first to the bronze castle, then to the silver
one, and lastly to that of gold.<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> This is a variety of the
same myth, and represents similarly the solar voyage from
evening to morning. The next mythical legend, however,
probably alludes rather to the three days of the winter
solstice, which the sun takes to return. The hero, Theodore,
finds a horse that has been just brought forth, which the
wolves have driven towards him; he makes it pasture
upon the dew for three dawns (like the Hungarian Tátos,
who feeds upon the golden oats in a silver field, that is
to say, who, during the silvery night, or else during the
white dawn, or the snowy winter, absorbs the dewy
humours of the spring, or the morning aurora). The
first day, the young horse becomes as high as half a tree;
the second, higher than the tree; the third day it is as high
as the heavens, and bears the hero Theodore and his
wife Anastasia on its back.</p>

<p>Ivan Durák watches three nights at his father's tomb.<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
His father tells him that if at any time of need he calls
with a hero's whistle, a wonderful grey horse will appear
to help him, whose eyes shoot flames, and from whose
nostrils issues smoke. Ivan does so, and is answered; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>gets into his right ear, and comes out of the left. By
means of this horse, Ivan succeeds in taking down the
portrait of the Tzar's daughter three times, though hung
high up on the wall of the palace, and thus obtains the
beautiful princess to wife.</p>

<p>According to another variety of this story,<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Ivan, the
third and foolish brother, goes with the most worthless
jade in the stable into the open air, and calls up the grey
horse with a loud shout; he enters into him by one ear,
and comes out at the other. Two young horsemen (the
Açvinâu) appear to him, and make a horse with golden
mane and tail come forth; upon this horse Ivan succeeds
in three times kissing, through twelve glasses (the glass
mountain of the Esthonian story), the daughter of the
Tzar, who therefore becomes his wife. Here, therefore,
we find the ugly horse which is made beautiful by the
two horsemen, represented by the two ears of the grey
horse out of which they come. These two horsemen give
the hero a better steed. Be it understood that their own
heroic steed (that is, the sun's horse), from being ugly or
asinine during the night, became beautiful and noble; in
the Küllaros of the Dioscuri, too, we ought probably to
recognise a courser that has been transformed from an ass
to a heroic horse.</p>

<p>Sometimes, instead of the horse, we have only its head.

her to relieve and cover it; at last it invites her to enter
the right ear and come out of the left one. The persecuted
girl comes out in the form of an exceedingly beautiful
maiden. The step-mother sends her own daughter to try
the same means of becoming beautiful; but she maltreats
the mare's head, and the mare's head devours her.</p>

<p>There is also a singularly clear allusion to the Açvinâu
in the forty-fourth story of the fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,
which seems to me to be a full confirmation of these interpretations.
When Basiliça, the girl persecuted by
her step-mother, approaches the house of the old witch
(the baba-jegá), she sees galloping towards the great door
of it a black horseman, dressed all in black, upon a black
horse, who disappears underground, upon which night
begins.<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> When the day begins to appear, Basiliça sees
before her a white horseman, dressed all in white, upon a
white horse, caparisoned in white. The maiden goes on;
when the sun begins to rise, she sees a red horseman,
dressed in red, upon a red horse.<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> The myth does not
require comment; but it happens to be given to us in
the story itself by the witch, who, to appease the curiosity
of the girl Basiliça, reveals to her that the black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>horseman represents the dark night (no&#263; tiómnaja), the
white horseman the clear day (dien jasnoi), and the red
horseman the little red sun (solnishko krasnoje).</p>

<p>Returning from Slavonic to Asiatic tradition, we meet
with the same myths.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the demoniacal horse, or demon of
horses. The <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> already knows it; the yâtudhanas,
or monster, feeds now upon human flesh (like the Bucephalus
of the legend of Alexander), now upon horse
flesh, and now milk from cows. We have said it seems
probable that the custom of keeping a lamp lighted in
the stables is a form of exorcism against the demon; the
<i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, indeed, tells us that Agnis (that is, Fire, with
his flame) cuts off the heads of such monsters.<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> But
this is not enough; the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> offers us in the same
hymn the proof of another identification. We have seen
in the last chapter how Rebhas, the invoker, is the third
brother, whom his envious and perfidious brothers threw
into the well; and we have seen above how Ivan, who
is also the third brother, invokes with a sonorous voice
the grey horse which is to help him, and how the same
Ivan is the one that discovers the monstrous horse which
ravages the seed or the crops in his father's field. In
the same Vedic hymn where the flame of Agnis beats
down the heads of the monster that torments horses,
Agnis (that is, fire) is invoked in order that the hero
Rebhas may see the monster which devastates with its
claws.<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Rebhas and Bhu&#501;yus are two names of the hero
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>who falls into the cistern in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>. We have
seen, not long ago, in the Russian story, that Ivan, the
third brother, who is thrown down into the cistern, is
delivered by the red horse. The Açvinâu, in the
<i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, deliver Bhu&#501;yus out of the sea by means of
red-winged horses.<a name="FNanchor_572_572" id="FNanchor_572_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> Here the grey and imperfect horse
of night is become a red horse. In the same Vedic hymn,
Rebhas, overwhelmed in the waters, is identified with his
own horse (Ivan is son of the bitch, or the cow, or the
mare), he being compared to a horse hidden by wicked ones.<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>We saw above, in the Russian story, how the two
horsemen who come out of the grey horse's ear give to
the foolish Ivan, who has an ugly and worthless horse, a
handsome hero's palfrey, by means of which he accomplishes
the arduous undertakings which entitle him to
the hand of the king's daughter. It is remarkable how
completely the Vedic myth agrees with this European
legend. The Açvinâu have given, for his eternal happiness,
a luminous horse to him who has a bad one.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> In
another hymn, the god Agnis gives to his worshipper
a pious, truthful, invincible, and very glorious son, who
vanquishes heroes, and a swift, victorious, and unconquered
horse.<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p>

<p>We have seen, moreover, how Ivan, the most popular
type of the Russian hero, has always to make three essays
before he accomplishes his undertaking upon the wonderful
horse which he has obtained from the two horsemen.
The <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, which celebrates the famous mythical enterprise
of the three steps of Vish&#7751;us, of the great body
(b&#7771;iha&#263;&#263;harîra&#7717;),<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> of the very vast step (urukramish&#7789;a&#7717;),<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>
who, in three steps, measured or traversed the whole
span of the heavens,<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> betrays in another hymn the secret
of Vish&#7751;us's success in this divine enterprise, since it
says that when, with the strength of Indras, he made his
three steps, he was drawn by the two fair-haired horses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>of Indras<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> (that is, the two Açvinâu lent him the swift
and strong horse which was to bear him on to victory).
The three steps of Vish&#7751;us correspond, therefore, to the
three stations of Ivan, to the three races of the young
hero to win the beautiful princess. Vish&#7751;us also appears
in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_580_580" id="FNanchor_580_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> in the midst of the sea of liquified
butter, attractive to all beings, in the form of a horse's
head. Hero and the solar or lunar horse are identified.</p>

<p>Indras is requested to yoke his right and his left
(horses), to approach, inebriated, his dear wife.<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> By
means of the horse obtained from the two horsemen, the
Russian Ivan acquires his wife; in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, the
two Açvinâu themselves, by means of their rapid chariot,
became husbands of the daughter of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> The
horses of the sun are so fully identified with the chariot
drawn by them, that they are said to be dependent on
it, united with it, and almost born of it.<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> The Açvinâu,
therefore, by means of the horse now enable the wife to
be found by the solar hero, by the old &#262;yavanas made
young again (Tithôn),<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> now by the sun, and now find her
themselves (perhaps drawing the chariot like horses).
Râmas, too, who is represented in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i><a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> as
the deliverer of Sîtâ, is compared to the solar horse, to
the sun born upon the mountain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>We have seen in the Russian stories how the horse's
head possesses the same magic power as the marvellous
horse which the two horsemen give to the hero Ivan.
Thus, in the Vedic myth, and in the corresponding
brâhmanic tradition, the horse's head Dadhya&#324;&#263; stands
in direct relation with the myth of the Açvinâu. The
wise Dadhya&#324;&#263; shows himself pious towards the Açvinâu,
to whom, although he knows that he will pay with
his head for the revelation he makes, he communicates
what he knows concerning the ambrosia or the Madhuvidyâ.
For this, accordingly, Dadhya&#324;&#263; forfeits his
head; but the Açvinâu present him with a horse's head
(his own), which heroically achieves wonders. With the
bones of Dadhya&#324;&#263;, or with the head of the horse
Dadhya&#324;&#263; (he who walks in butter or ambrosia), fished
up in the ambrosial lake Çarya&#7751;âvat (the head of the
horse Vish&#7751;us in the sea of butter),<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> Indras discomfits
the ninety-nine hostile monsters (as Samson the Philistines
with the jawbone of an ass).<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> This exchange of heads
seems to be common to the traditions which are founded
upon the myth of the Açvinâu, that is, to the legends of the
two brother or companion heroes. In the <i>Tuti-Name</i>,<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> the
heads of the prince and of the Brâhman, who are exceedingly
like each other, are cut off and then fastened on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>again; but, by some mistake, the head of the one is
attached to the body of the other, so that the prince's
wife is embarrassed between them. This exchange of the
husband (which corresponds to the exchange of the wife
in the legend of Berta, referred to in the first chapter) is
very frequent in the legend of the two brothers, and often
ends in the rupture of the perfect concord reigning between
them. The two brothers or companions who dispute
about the wife, is a variety of the legend of the three
brothers who, having delivered the beautiful princess,
wish to divide her between them.</p>

<p>The <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> does not seem as yet explicitly to exhibit
the two Açvinâu at discord&mdash;they generally are united
in doing good; but as we already know the Vedic blind
man and lame man who are cured by the grace of Indras,
or of the Açvinâu themselves; as we know that the
Açvinâu, in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, make Dadhya&#324;&#263;, who has a
horse's head, conduct them to the ambrosia, or indicate
where it is, probably in order that they may procure
health and strength for themselves; as in the ninth
strophe of the 117th hymn of the first book of the
<i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, the marvellous horse of the Açvinâu, which
kills the monster-serpent (ahihan), is but one; as we know
that the Açvinâu run to gain the bride for themselves;
and as we cannot ignore the fact that in the story of the
blind and lame man, when a woman comes upon the
scene, they endeavour to do harm to each other; as
we know that of the two Hellenic brothers, the Dioscuri,
one alone had from the gods the gift of immortality; as,
finally, it is known to us that of the two brothers, he
alone is the true hero who, by means of his horse, gains
the victory over the monster,&mdash;it is clear that if we have
not as yet in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> the myth of the two brothers
at discord, we have, at least, in the ambrosia, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
bride won by them the origin of the myth already indicated;
and from the idea of the privileged brother that
of the envious one would naturally arise.</p>

<p>In Hesiod's <i>Theogony</i> we have the two brothers
Chrysäor and Pêgasos, that come out of the Medusa
(the evening aurora), who is made pregnant by Poseidôn,
after Perseus has cut off her head. Pêgasos, the younger
brother, becomes the heroic horse. In Hesiod himself,
and in the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid, he carries the thunder
and the thunderbolts for Zeus. The hero Bellerophontes
rides him, and vanquishes, by his help, the Chimaira and
the Amazons; he becomes the horse of the aurora, the
horse of the Muses, the ambrosial steed. The monstrous
Chimaira appears, in the <i>Theogony</i> of Hesiod, as the
daughter of Typhaon and the Echidna, the monstrous
daughter of Chrysäor. Therefore in the conflict which
Bellerophontes maintains against the Chimaira, we have
a form of the battle which goes on between the twin
horses Pêgasos and Chrysäor, the one divine, the other
demoniacal.</p>

<p>In the analogous myth of the Hellenic Dioscuri (the
sons of the luminous one, <i>i.e.</i>, of Zeus, just as the Vedic
Açvinâu are the sons of the luminous sky;<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> Zeus is
united with the Dioscuri, as Indras is with the Açvinâu),
we again find the twins who fight to recover a woman
who had been carried off from them, <i>i.e.</i>, their own sister
Helen. One of the two brothers is mortal, and the other
immortal; he who is immortal passes the night in hell
with his mortal brother. The double aspect of the sun,
which at evening enters and loses itself in the night, now
black, now illumined by the moon, and which, in the
morning, comes forth in a luminous form, has enriched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
the story of the two brothers of mythology. One of
the two brothers, the red horseman, is in especial relation
with the morning sun; the other, in intimate connection
with the silvery moon, the white horseman, and
when the latter is amissing, with the infernal gloom.</p>

<p>Several mythologists have interpreted the Açvinâu as
only the two twilights; but it seems more exact, inasmuch
as they are often found together, whilst the two
twilights are always apart, to recognise in them two
crepuscular lights, the lunar of evening and autumn, and
the solar of morning and spring.<a name="FNanchor_590_590" id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> Of the twin-brothers,
one is always imperfect; the lunar crepuscular light offers
us a similar imperfection, with respect to the sun. Inasmuch
as the Açvinâu are affiliated both to the sun and
the moon, when they come out of the two ears of the
horse of night, we should understand, it would appear,
that on one side the moon goes down, while on the
other the sun is born, or that the solar horse arises, upon
which the young hero lost in the night mounts and wins
the princess aurora. In the Russian stories referred to
in the preceding chapter, we have seen how the maiden
abandons her hero-husband, or brother, to give herself
into the monster's hands; the evening aurora forsakes
the sun to throw herself into the night, and the evening
twilight stays for a long time with the evening aurora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
(the reddish sky of evening), when the sun is already
gone. In the morning the two lovers, the twilight, or
sun and moon, and the aurora, meet once more; when
the sun, or solar hero, arrives, he surprises them <i>in flagrante
delicto</i>, and punishes them. Sometimes, on the
contrary, the twilight and the aurora stay together, preserving
their chastity; in this case the brother twilight
figures as the good and honest guardian of the rights of
his brother the sun. This appears to me to have been
the most ancient, as it is the most subtle, interpretation
of the myth; afterwards, it is possible, and even probable,
that in the two Açvinâu only the two gods of morning
and of evening were seen, with their respective twilights,
considered as two brothers, so like that they were easily
mistaken for each other. But from the data of the
Russian story, which gives us the lunar twilight as a
white horseman and the rising sun as a red one, the
aurora being found exactly between the white and the
red horsemen, between the moon or the white dawn (alba)
and the sunrise, and seeing that the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, which makes
the aurora mount upon the chariot of the Açvinâu, considers
them in the celebrated nuptial hymn as the <i>paranymphoi</i>
of Sûryâ, the daughter of the sun or of the
aurora herself, I venture to insist upon my interpretation
as the most obvious, and perhaps the most logical
one. The two brothers may very naturally be conceived
of as contending for the possession of the bride when
they have her between them, since the Açvinâu, considered
as lunar light and sun, really take the aurora between
them. The Vedic hymn cited above shows us how both the
Açvinâu, arriving on the swift-running chariot, became
the husbands of Sûryâ, the daughter of the sun. But
this very Sûryâ, in the Vedic nuptial hymn, must be
satisfied with one husband, who is called Somas, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the Açvinâu can only occupy the place of paranymphs.
The Açvinâu, therefore, would appear to be excluded
from the wedding of Sûryâ as principal personages; they
would seem to be nothing more than assistants, and, in
fact, they often assume this part in the Vedic hymns, by
enabling now the bride to find a husband, now the
husband to recover his bride. We know already that by
means of them &#262;yavanas, the old sun (a Vedic Tithôn),
became young again, and was able to espouse the aurora.
We know that they gave sight to Vandanas (properly,
the Face), that they made the blind see,<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> the lame walk,
and performed sundry other works of charity, which
would, however, have been much more glorious if these
acts did not, in fact, always issue in benefit to themselves,
as blind, lame, or drowned. It is hence very probable
that when they give a bride to the hero, they, being now
lunar, now solar heroes, do only appropriate her to themselves.
When, therefore, we read that the Açvinâu assist
as paranymphs at the nuptials of Sûryâ and Somas, we are
much inclined to think that under Somas in this case one
of the Açvinâu is hidden. In Indras and Somas, often
sung of together in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, it seems to me that we
have just another form of the Açvinâu, the more so
because I also find them both, like the Açvinâu, personified
in one and the same horse, whose back is covered
with honey, and who is terrible and swift,<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> and because
they are invoked together against the yâtudhânas, which,
by the grace of the Açvinâu, the hero Rebhas succeeds
in discovering and then chasing away.<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> The <i>Tâittiriya</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span><i>Brâhma&#7751;am</i><a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> represents to us the daughter of the sun
(Sâvitrî) by the name of Sîtâ, as enamoured of Somas,
who, on the contrary, loves another woman, the Çraddhâ
(<i>i.e.</i>, Faith), almost as if the daughter of the sun, the
aurora, were, for him at least, a symbol of infidelity.
Probably this embryo of a myth refers to the passage of
the aurora, in the morning, from her amours with the
white horseman (the white twilight), which, as we have
said, was supposed to be in particular relation with the
moon (Somas), to her amours with the red horseman (the
sun), or, <i>vice versa</i>, to the aurora who, in the evening,
abandons the red horseman, the sun (now her father, now
her husband), to throw herself into the arms of the white
horseman, the white twilight, the king Somas, or silver
god Lunus. Moreover, Yâskas, in the <i>Niruktam</i>,<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> already
notices that the Açvinâu were identified now with the
day and the night,<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> now with the sun and the moon.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we read that the Açvinâu obtained
for their wife the daughter of the sun, and when we learn
that she chose both for husbands,<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> we must interpret the
passage with discrimination, and conclude that one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>them was sometimes preferred, inasmuch as the Vedic
nuptial hymn speaks of only one husband of Sûryâ, with
the name of Somas, with whom, as we have said, Yâskas
identifies one of the Açvinâu. We read in <i>Pausanias</i>
that, among the Greek usages, when the bride was conducted
to the bridegroom's house, she was accustomed to
mount a chariot and sit down in the middle, having the
bridegroom on one side, and on the other her nearest
relation as paranymphos. The preference given to one
of the two brothers over the other is naturally suggestive
of a contention between them; however, as I say, the
<i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, which offers us already the myth of the third
brother abandoned in the well by his relations, does not
record any example of an open strife between the two
brothers (<i>i.e.</i>, the Açvinâu, the lunar and the solar
light).</p>

<p>An evidently Hindoo variation of this myth is contained
in the well-known episode of the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,
which relates the adventures of Sundas and Upasundas, two
inseparable brothers, who lived together in love and concord,
each being ruled by the will of the other, and who had
never all their lives either said or done anything to displease
each other. The gods become envious of their virtue,
and wish to prove it, and send to seduce them a nymph
of enchanting beauty. The two brothers, on seeing her,
desire each the exclusive possession of the divine maiden,
and strive between themselves to carry her off. They
fight so long and so desperately that they both die (the
moon and the sun see the aurora in the morning, and
dispute for her; they see her again in the evening, and
fight so long that they both perish miserably, and die in
the night). The gods who are envious of the virtue of
the two brothers Sundas and Upasundas, are the same
as those who, envying the good which the Açvinâu do to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
mankind, treat them as celestial Çudrâs, under the pretext
that they pollute themselves by their contact with men, and
refuse to admit them, being impure, to the sacrifices.<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a></p>

<p>In the twin brothers, Nakulas and Saladevas, sons of
the Açvinâu, the Açvinâu themselves revive again, are
made better, according to the expression of the first book
of the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>. The first-born, Nakulas, too, is
perhaps the real Açvin who kills the monster. Nakulas
is the name given to the <i>viverra ichneumon</i>, the mortal
enemy of the serpents, which refers us back to the horse
Ahihan (or killer of the serpent), as the horse of the
Açvinâu, or perhaps rather of one of the Açvinâu, is
called, in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>. Of the two Dioscuri, moreover,
one alone is especially the horseman; the other is the
valiant in combat.<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> The mortal brother, he who has to
remain in hell, and who has to fight the monsters of
night, is Castor the horseman. Pollux, the strong-armed,
is, on the contrary, the immortal one, the daily sun, he
who profits from the victory obtained by his brother who
has fought in the night, during which the Gandharvâs
(the horses in the perfumes, they who walk in perfume)
also ride upon war-horses, heroic, invulnerable, divine,
exceedingly swift, who change colour at will&mdash;the Gandharvâs,
whose strength increases during the night, as one
of them informs Ar&#501;unas in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, when
communicating to him Gandharvic knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, the two brothers Râmas and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>Lakshma&#7751;as are compared to the Açvinâu, to the sun
and moon, as similar the one to the other; and their reciprocal
love reminds us of that of the Açvinâu.<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> Râmas
and Lakshma&#7751;as are always at peace with each other;
there is, however, a passage which may serve as a link
to connect the myth of the two friendly brothers and
that of the two hostile ones. When Râmas combats
alone in the forest thousands of monsters, Lakshma&#7751;as
stays with Sîtâ, hidden in a cavern.</p>

<p>But the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> itself shows us the two brothers
in open strife in the legend of the two brothers Bâlin
and Sugrîvas, children of the sun, beauteous as the two
Açvinâu, so perfectly like one another that it is impossible
to distinguish one from the other; and so that when Râmas,
to please Sugrîvas, wishes to kill Bâlin, he does not know
which to strike, until Sugrîvas puts a garland on his head
as a sign of recognition.<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> Once Bâlin and Sugrîvas were
intimate friends, but, on account of a woman, they became
mortal enemies. Sugrîvas complains that Bâlin,
his elder brother, has deprived him of his wife Rumâ;<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>
but it is not certain that Sugrîvas did not rather steal
Bâlin's wife. Bâlin seems especially to represent the
evening sun; the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i><a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> says of him that, while
the sun is not risen (<i>i.e.</i>, in the night), he is unweariedly
passing from the western to the eastern ocean; by this is
described the supposed voyage of the sun in the ocean of
night, in the grotto or the darkness. When Bâlin is in
the grotto, he is betrayed by his brother Sugrîvas. The
two brothers, Bâlin and Sugrîvas, while still friends, set
out together to follow the monster Mâyâvin (the brother
of Dundubhis, who, in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> itself,<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> fights in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>the shape of a demoniacal buffalo against Bâlin, near the
entrance of the cave). The moon rises to show them the
way. The monster escapes into the cavern, upon which
Bâlin enters and follows him, whilst Sugrîvas remains
without, awaiting his return. After waiting a long
time, Sugrîvas sees blood flow out of the cave (in analogous
legends, instead of blood, it is a treasure, or else a
princess or a beautiful maiden comes out in shining
garments). This is the blood of the monster, killed by
Bâlin; but Sugrîvas believes it to be that of his brother
Bâlin. He returns home, and showing his sorrow in
public, declares that Bâlin is dead, and allows himself to
be consecrated king in his stead (probably also enjoying
with the crown the wife of his brother). Meanwhile
Bâlin, after having killed the monster Mâyâvin, endeavours
to come out of the cavern, but he finds the
entrance closed. Attributing at once this wicked action
to the brother Sugrîvas, he succeeds, after great efforts,
in effecting an opening; he comes out, returns to the
palace, and expels Sugrîvas from it, whom he persecutes
ever after.<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> Even Añgadas, Bâlin's son, irritated one day
with Sugrîvas, accuses him of having once shut up his
brother Bâlin in the cave, in order to possess himself of
the latter's wife.</p>

<p>In the <i>Avesta</i>, the name and the myth of Kereçâçpa
seems to me to be of special interest. To the Zend word
<i>kereçâçpa</i> corresponds the Sansk&#7771;it <i>k&#7771;içâçvas</i> (the name
of a warlike &#7771;ishis and hero), that is, he of the lean
horse. The hero Kereçâçpa has, in the <i>Avesta</i>, a brother
called Urvâksha (a word which is perhaps the same as
<i>urvâçpa</i>, and, if this equivalence is admitted, <i>urvâksha</i>
would mean him of the fat or great horse, of the heroic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
horse.<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> We have already noticed that the Vedic and
Slavonic hero begins his fortune with an ugly and bad
horse; the hero Kereçâçpa, too, of the two brothers of
the Zend myth, is the good, the heroic, and truly glorious
one. His brother, Urvâksha, according to a Parsee
tradition,<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> was banished to hell because he had struck the
fire which did not obey his commands (the evening sun
which descends into the infernal night); Kereçâçpa
avenges him. This is evidently a Persian form of the
myth of the Dioscuri, who, as it seems to me, reappear
once more in the two Zend brothers, Gustâçp and
Açpâyaodha (he who fights with the horse).</p>

<p>In the epic poem of Firdusi, the two brothers Piran
and Pilsem, who fight together against the Turanians,
and of whom the former and elder delivers the latter and
younger from the dangers that he is exposed to among
the enemies, seem to me re-embodiments of the same
myth.</p>

<p>We find the cloudy or tenebrous sky of night represented
in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> and in the <i>Avesta</i> as açman, or
mountain of stone. When the evening sun falls upon
the mountain, it turns to stone, and the whole sky
assumes the colour of this mountain. When the hero of
the popular story follows the monster, the latter hides
under a rock; the hero lifts up the rock and descends
into the grotto, that is, hides himself in the mountain of
stone, or is turned to stone, and if he has a horse, it
undergoes the same transformation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>In the story of Merhuma, who is stoned (the aurora
lost in the mountain of stone), in the <i>Tuti-Name</i>,<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> we
have the brother possessed by a demon, who seduces the
wife of his brother, who is travelling abroad. In that of
Mansûr, in the same <i>Tuti-Name</i>,<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> the monstrous Fari
assumes the very shape of the absent husband, and
succeeds in seducing his wife. In another story in
the <i>Tuti-Name</i>,<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> two brothers, finding themselves
deceived in their expectations, set out together, each,
for love of the other, wandering about the world
in search of a better fate. These are three forms of
the myth of the Açvinâu. With them is connected
the story of the maiden who comes out of the wood,
of whom as many men, when she appears, become
enamoured.<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>The fifth Calmuck story (of Hindoo origin) is unmistakably
a reproduction of the myth of the Açvinâu,
even to the very mythical names themselves. The
king, Kun-snang (he who illumines all, like the Vedic
Viçvavedas and the Slavonic Vsievedas, the all-seer), has
by two different mothers two sons&mdash;Sunlight (born in the
year of the tiger; perhaps in the sol-leo, in July, in
summer, under the solar influence) and Moonlight. The
second wife does not love her step-son Sunlight, and
persecutes him, but the two brothers are devoted to each
other, and when Sunlight goes into exile (like Râmas),
Moonlight follows him (as Lakshma&#7751;as follows Râmas,
as the white lunar twilight follows the sun in the forest
of night). On the way, Moonlight is thirsty; Sunlight
goes to find water for him, but in the meantime Moonlight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>dies.<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> Sunlight returns, and is in despair at the
sight of his dead brother; however, a hermit has pity
upon him, and, having resuscitated Moonlight, adopts
the two brothers as his own sons. Near his abode there
is a kingdom where the dragons keep back the waters,
unless they are given a young man born in the year of
the tiger. It oozes out that Sunlight is such a young
man, and he is led away to the king of that country.
The daughter of the king falls in love with him, and
begs Sunlight not to be given to the dragons. The
king is furious against his daughter, and has her thrown
with Sunlight into the swamp where the dragons are.<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>
The young couple break out into such piteous lamentations,
that the dragons are touched, and let Sunlight and
the young princess go free. When free, they find Moonlight,
who also becomes the husband of the beautiful
princess, the two brothers being inseparable, like the
Vedic Açvinâu. The three personages (white twilight,
or white moonlight, aurora, and sun) return together
into the kingdom of their birth, where, upon seeing them
arrive, Sunlight's step-mother (Night) dies of terror.
Here the legend has all its mythical splendour.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth Mongol story, on the contrary, the
friendship of the two companions cannot last, because of
the perfidy of one of them; while they are travelling
in the forest, the minister's son kills the king's
son.</p>

<p>In the history of <i>Ardshi-Bordshi</i>, the two men born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>in the palace are so like each other in everything, in
shape, complexion, dress, and horses, that they cannot
be distinguished one from the other; hence they dispute
between themselves for the possession of everything, of
wife and sons. One is made like the other by witchcraft;
he is the son of a demon; and it is the marvellous king
of the children who discovers the secret.<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>This exchange of husbands, or heroes, by means of
demoniacal craft, often occurs in European fairy-tales,
like the exchange of wives. The demon is now a water-carrier,
now a washerman, now a woodcutter, now a
charcoal-burner, now a gipsy, now a Saracen, and now
the devil <i>in propria persona</i>.</p>

<p>The Russian fairy-tales show us the two forms of the
two brothers or companions, <i>i.e.</i>, the two that remain
friends <i>usque ad mortem</i>, and the friend betrayed by his
perfidious companion.</p>

<p>We find a zoological form of the legend of the two
friends in one of Afanassieff's stories. The horse delivers
the child of one of his masters from the bear, upon which
his grateful masters feed him better, whereas before they
had almost let him die of starvation. The horse (the sun)
remembers in prosperity his companion in misfortune, the
cat (the moon), who is also allowed to starve, and gives
it a part of what he receives from his masters. The latter
perceive this, and again ill-treat the horse, who then forms
the resolution of killing himself, in order that the cat
may eat him; but the cat refuses to eat his friend the
horse,<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> and is also determined to die.</p>

<p>The two brothers who, because they have eaten one
the head and the other the heart of a duck, are predestined,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>in <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> one to be king and the other to
spit gold, flee from their perfidious mother (probably
step-mother), who persecutes them in their father's
absence. They meet with a cowherd taking his cows to
the pasturage, and are hospitably entertained by him.
Then, continuing their journey, they come to a place
where two roads meet, where, upon a pillar, this is
written, "He who goes to the right (to the east) will
become a king; he who goes to the left (to the west,
into the kingdom of Kuveras, the western sun, the god
of riches; when the sun rises in the east the moon goes
down in the west) will become rich." One goes to the
right; when it is morning, he rises, washes, and dresses
himself. He learns that the old king is dead (the old
sun), and that funeral honours are being paid to him in
church. A decree says that he whose candle lights of
itself will be the new Tzar.<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> The Vedic god also has
the distinctive attribute of this wonderful candle, that
of being lighted by himself, of shining of himself, <i>i.e.</i>, he
is svabhânus. The candle, therefore, of our youth predestined
to be king lights of its own accord, and he is immediately
proclaimed the new king. The daughter of the
old king (the aurora) marries him, recognising in him her
predestined husband, and makes with her golden ring (the
solar disc) a mark upon his forehead (as Râmas does with
Sîtâ). The young man (the sun), after having remained
some time with his bride (the aurora), wishes to go towards
the part where his brother went (that is, to the left, to the
west). He traverses for a long time different countries
(<i>i.e.</i>, the sun describes the whole arc of heaven which
arches over the earth), and finds at last (in the western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>sky, towards the setting sun) his brother, who lives in
great wealth. In his rooms whole mountains of gold
arise; when he spits, all is gold; there is no place to put
it,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> (the evening sky is one mass of gold). The two
brothers then set out together to find their poor old
father (the sun during the night). The younger brother
goes to find for himself a bride (probably the silvery
moon), and the wicked mother (the step-mother, night)
is forsaken. Here, too, the legend is entirely of a
mythical character. In the two brothers we see now
twilight and sun, now the two twilights, now the
spring and autumnal lights, now the sun and the moon,
but always the Açvinâu, always two deities, two heavenly
beings closely connected with the phenomena of the
lunar and solar light.</p>

<p>And here allow me to say that I deem it enough for
me to collect in one body legends which betray a
common origin; as to explaining all mythology in the
legends, this is beyond my power, and therefore outside
my pretensions. I only point out, as I proceed, interpretations
which I think come near the truth; but the
objects embodied in mythology are so mobile and
multiform, that, if grasped too tightly, they easily
evaporate and disappear. Their richness consists in
their very mobility and uncertainty. If the sun and
moon were always seen in the same place, there would be
no myths. The myths which originated the greatest
number of legends are those which are founded upon
the most fleeting phenomena of the sky.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> The myth of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>Açvinâu cannot be solved by mathematical demonstrations,
precisely on account of the uncertainty presented
by the crepuscular light which probably gave rise to it.
This continuous succession of shadows, penumbræ,
chiaroscuri, and shades of light, from the black darkness
to the silver moon, from the silver moon to the grey
twilight of morning, which gradually melts into, and
confounds itself with the dawn, from the dawn to the
aurora, from the aurora to the sun; the same variations
recurring, but inversely, in the evening, from the dying
sun to the reddish and blood-coloured sky or evening
aurora, from the evening aurora to the grey twilight,
from the grey twilight to the silver moon, from the
silver moon to the gloomy night,&mdash;this continual change
of colours, which meet, unite with, and pass into each
other, originated the idea of celestial companions, friends,
or relations, who are now in unison and now separate,
who now approach to love each other, to move together
and affectionately follow each other, now rush upon each
other to fight, despoil, betray, and destroy each other
turn by turn, who now attract and are now attracted,
are now seduced and now seducers, now cheated and
now deceivers, now victims, now sacrificers. Where there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
is a family, there is love, hence come exemplary brothers,
husbands, wives, sons, daughters, fathers, and mothers,
full of tenderness; that is the obverse of the medal: where
there are relations, there are disputes, hence contentions
between brothers, out of jealousy in love, or envy of
riches; perverse mothers-in-law, step-mothers, and sisters-in-law,
tyrannous fathers, perfidious wives; that is the
reverse. This contradiction of feelings is difficult to explain
psychologically even in man; how much more,
therefore, is it so when it has to be analysed in a
mythical image, which assumes an animal form in one
rapid flash of imagination, and then disappears? On
this account, in the case of some myths, we must content
ourselves with a general demonstration, at least until
new and positive data appear, on which it may be
possible to base, in a solid foundation, the real nature of
the details of mythology. In the absence of these data,
we can only offer probabilities, and not rules to the
reader. As to the Vedic Açvinâu, this much is certain:
they are found in unison with their wife, the aurora, after
having passed through the dangers of night, or after
having enabled the heroes protected by them&mdash;that is to
say, their own heroic forms&mdash;to pass through them; they
are two splendid brother-horsemen; and they are
especially invoked in the first hours of morning. The
myth in this Vedic form would not appear to be of
dubious interpretation. The white moon and the sun
take the aurora between them, that is, marry her; or
else they present her in marriage to Somas (with whom
one of the Açvinâu, the white light or twilight, is in
particular relation), in the quality of paranymphs. The
aurora, in the morning, as well as in the evening, taken
between the sun and the moon, disappears. One would
think that the twilight and the sun present her together at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
the same time to the king or god Somas, or Lunus, for
whom the daughter of the sun has affection. One would
also think that she was especially united with the twilight,
which is in especial relation with Somas, observing
how in the morning the aurora immediately succeeds the
twilight, and disappears when the sun shows himself,
that is, rejoins the twilight and forsakes the sun; and
how in the evening, when the sun hides himself, or when
her husband is absent, she again unites herself with the
twilight, with whom she again flees and disappears, to
reappear once more with him in the morning. To continue;
the absence of the sun during the night tormented
the popular phantasy in several ways. As much as the
aspect of the sky was negative with regard to the
mythical hero&mdash;that is to say, as much as the hero or
god hides himself from the view&mdash;just so much the
more does popular imagination invest him with positive
qualities and exalt his greatness. The greatest of all
deities is that which is seen the least;&mdash;would that
Roman Catholic priests understood this mythological
truth! Indras and Zeus are great when within the
thundering and lightning cloud. The sun becomes a
hero when he loses himself in the darkness of night and
in the cloud. But it is just at this very point that the
demonstration of mythical particulars becomes more
difficult, because the myths are now founded, not merely
upon an external appearance or image, but often upon a
simple subjective hypothesis; and while the ancient
image, possessing an objectivity irrespective of the
subject, can always be reconciled with the observation
of the new celestial phenomena which reproduce it, the
subjective hypothesis, being an individual phantasy, is
lost. The demonstration is therefore possible only in
the essential parts. When the sun was seen to disappear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
in the nocturnal sky, this sky appeared in the various
aspects of an ocean, a mountain, a forest, a cavern, or a
voracious monster which devoured the hero. But has the
sun lost himself by accident, or has he been precipitated
into the night by the aurora and her crepuscular lover,
perfidiously united together, in order that they may
have more freedom in their loves? This is a dilemma of
which the two solutions originate a double series of
legends,&mdash;the brother betrayed by the brother, and the
hero who goes to succour his unfortunate brother fallen
into the power of the monsters. The hour of day which
the French indicate by the expressive phrase <i>entre chien
et loup</i>, is the great epical hour of the fox, which partakes
of the nature of the domestic dog and the savage
wolf. It is the hour of betrayals, of perfidies, of doubts,
and mythical uncertainties. Who can tell whether the
aurora is a widow by an accident which happens to her
husband the sun, or whether she herself has betrayed
him?&mdash;whether she has been a chaste and faithful
Geneviève, or a perfidious and luxurious Helen? It is
these very mythical doubts which have made the fortune
and the charm of tradition, as they are the despair of
mythologists. When, moreover, the sun is within the
night, what can he do? According to the different
aspect assumed by the night, the acts of the solar hero
lost in it are modified, and these modifications can be
explained without too great an effort of imagination;
but, sometimes, the relations between the hero and his
companions or brothers in the world of the dead, can
only be conceived by means of poetical dreams. When
the sun is seen to enter the obscure night in the evening,
and to come out of it safe and sound in the morning,
after having dispersed the darkness, it is natural to think
that throughout the night he is singly intent upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
killing the monster. The action of the principal hero
is well defined, and therefore evident; and the reference is
equally clear when the aurora is represented as experiencing
the same fate as the sun, her husband or brother.
They descend together into the night, which makes them
invisible, and together emerge from it happily.</p>

<p>The myth becomes richer when the aurora throws herself
into the arms of a rival of her husband, because the
character of this rival is various. Now he is a handsome
youth who resembles the legitimate husband, either as
the twilight or as Lunus; now he is a real demoniacal
monster, the demon himself, the black night. In proportion
to the variety of aspects and relations which the
hero's rival assumes, does the myth become more complicated,
and its interpretation more difficult; hence the
story-tellers are often in the habit of interrupting their
narrative by saying, "Now, let us leave this or that
hero, and return to such or such another." These interruptions
of the stories have their mythological reason.
We can understand, for instance, how the aurora, or
daughter of the sun, should be conceived of as, in a
moment of feminine weakness, falling in love with the
moon, which she sees on the other side of the heavens,
and desirous of being conducted to him as his bride.
We can understand how Lunus, reciprocating the love-glance
of the aurora at the other extremity of the sky,
should appear to be drawing her to himself, and wishing
to seduce her. We can also understand how now the
moon, now the sun, appears to seduce the aurora and carry
her off from her legitimate husband. In these cases
the infidelity of the hero or the heroine is evident; but
woe to him who attempts to carry the demonstration or
the proof of this interpretation too far, for when the
seducer and seduced, be the seducer male or female,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
are thought of as enjoying together the fruits of their
perfidy, the myth must come to an end, as no one can
conceive the possibility of the moon and the aurora
living or doing anything together; no one can tell what
the aurora and the twilight, phenomena appertaining exclusively
to the morning and evening, and which only
appear when the sun rises from the mountain, do together
in the night. The phenomenon ceases, the mythical
personages vanish too, and the story-teller breaks off his
narrative, because he possesses no data upon which to continue
it. And so with all the myths; they can only
be explained on the condition that we do not insist upon
explaining too much. We must therefore be contented
to see the girl aurora carried off in the evening and the
hero sun recover her in the morning, or to conceive of the
aurora and the sun fleeing away together into the night,
but we must not be too inquisitive as to the manner in
which they do so. The moon, or good fairy, sometimes
teaches them the way; but their nocturnal actions are but
little seen into; those which are spoken of as performed
by them at night refer either to the moment in which
night begins, or to that in which it comes to an end.
During the night they wander about until they see a
light (the guiding moon or delivering light of day); they
remain in the chest or cask thrown into the water until
it is carried to the other shore beyond the sea, or on the
eastern coast. In their nocturnal journey the moon plays
the part now of the good old man, or the good fairy; now
of the good cow, or the bull; now of the grey horse, the
steed of night, who, in three stations, bears them to their
goal; now of the bird who, nourished upon their flesh,
carries them to their destination; and now we have, on
the contrary, the monster itself, or the step-mother who
threatens, tortures, and persecutes them. The hero shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
his greatest strength when hidden, but it is used now to
send out the cows, now to recover the ravished bride, now
to unchain the rivers kept back by the dragons, now to
make the water of health gush forth, and now to destroy
the monster and deliver himself. The hero displays his
greatest powers when contending with the monster; but it
is in order to his own deliverance. In the earliest epochs
of the legend he is foolish, ill, drunken, unhappy, and
stony; one can only speak of him by what is seen of him
externally. The cloud-barrel moves; it is the barrel full of
water which moves of its own accord in order to please
the hero: the cloud-barrel drops rain upon the earth; it is
the foolish one who lets the wine run out of the cask:
the cloud-forest moves; it is the trunk of a tree which
attaches itself to the horse ridden by the hero, and massacres
his enemies&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the cloud or darkness disappears,
and the hero comes out victorious. The part performed
by the solar hero in the night or in the cloud seems to
me, therefore, almost always of a nearly certain interpretation,
but only so long as he is alone, or with but one
companion; when the one hero is transformed into three,
or five, or six, who accompany each other, or when he
meets other mythical personages of a nature akin to
his own, and when he speaks and acts in unison with
them, the legend confuses the myth, in order to explain
which, we are often obliged to stretch the sense of the
adverb <i>together</i> to the signification, now of a whole
night, and now of an entire year. When we find, for
instance, in tradition, the twelve months of the year
associated with twelve old men round the fire, we know
that the fire is the sun, round which the twelve months
turn in the sky in the space of a year. Here <i>together</i> is
amplified to denote, therefore, the period of a year and
the entire width of the sky.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>I have been led into this long, but, I trust, not idle
digression, in order to explain the Russian story of the
two brothers, of whom it is said that they go together,
one to the right and the other to the left. In whatever
way the Açvinâu are to be understood, whether as twilight
and sun, as spring and autumn, or as sun and
moon, it is impossible to comprehend how they can
travel in the same direction; the ways they take must
therefore be separate. The sun and the evening twilight
do not advance in opposite directions; the morning sun
and that of evening occupy opposite positions, but
not at the same time; the sun and moon advance at
the same time in the sky, but not conjointly and upon
the same path, like two travelling companions. It is
therefore necessary to suppose that the journey of the
two brothers either happens at different periods, although
it may be in the same night or the same day, or else takes
its start from different places, although always in the
sky; in the evening the moon is seen advancing from
east to west, whilst the hidden sun travels from west to
east; when the sun has arrived in the east, the moon goes
down in the west. The eastern sun is bent, in the daytime,
upon following and finding his brother who has
gone to the west; and when he arrives there he sees,
besides his brother, his brother's immense treasures also.
With this is connected the other version of the myth of
the Açvinâu, the poor brother and the rich one. This is
probably the weary, thirsty, and hungry sun, who, having
during the day given all his wealth away, demands
hospitality from, and offers his services to, his rich
brother; the latter drives him away, and the poor
brother wanders alone, poorer and sadder than before,
into the forest, where he makes his fortune by digging
up a treasure which enriches him, whilst his rich brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
in the west becomes poor. The story of the treasure, in
connection with the two brothers and the skilful thief,
was familiar to the Greeks in the vicissitudes of Agamêdês
and Trophonios (in <i>Pausanias</i><a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>), who stole King Hürieus's
treasure, on which account one of the two brothers was
to lose his head.</p>

<p>Were I to follow the story of the two brothers in its
Western versions, I could compose an entire volume on
the subject, which is indeed of such interest that a student,
by connecting it with that of the three brothers, might
profitably address himself to the work. But to resume
the account of the horse. I must here limit myself to recording
only one other interesting variety of this legend,
offered us in the seventh story of Basile's <i>Pentamerone</i>.<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>There were once two brothers, named respectively
Cienzo and Meo (Vincenzo and Meo). When they were
born two enchanted horses and two enchanted dogs also
came into the world. Cienzo goes about the world in
search of fortune; he comes to a place where there is
a dragon with seven heads, from whom a beautiful
princess must be delivered. As long as he does not
cut all the heads off, the dragon goes and rubs itself
against a herb which possesses the virtue of fastening
on to the body again the head which had been cut off.
Cienzo cuts off all the dragon's heads, "pe gratia de lo
sole Lione" (by the grace of the Lion sun, <i>i.e.</i>, when the
sun is in the sign of Leo, which corresponds to the tiger
of the Indo-Turanian story recorded above, or when the
solar hero possesses all his strength; the lion and the tiger
are equivalent in Hindoo symbolism as heroic types, and
are therefore all the same in the zodiac). Cienzo marries
the beautiful princess delivered by him; but a beautiful
fairy who lives in the opposite house fascinates him by her
beauty, attracts him, and binds him with her hair. Meanwhile
Meo, who by signs settled upon beforehand learns
that his brother Cienzo is in danger, comes to the house
where the latter's wife lives, accompanied by his enchanted
horse and dog. The wife believes him to be Cienzo (the
story of the Menechmi, of the two brothers who resemble
each other in everything, was no doubt taken by the Greek
poet, and afterwards by Plautus, from popular tradition),
fêtes him on his arrival, and receives him into her bed;
but the faithful brother, in order not to touch her, divides
the sheets between them so that they have one each, and
refuses to touch his sister-in-law. Thus Sifrît, as well as
his Scandinavian <i>alter ego</i> Sigurd, places a sword between
himself and Brünhilt, the destined bride of the
king, in order not to touch her when she lies beside him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
and when Brünhilt throws herself upon the funeral pyre,
she also places a sword between herself and Sigurd's
corpse.<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> In the royal or heroic weddings by proxy of
the Middle Ages a similar custom was observed. In the
popular Piedmontese, Bergamasc, and Venetian song<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>
of the pilgrim who comes from Rome, the pilgrim is
separated from the woman only by a wisp of straw.
Towards morning Meo also sees the beautiful fairy in the
house over the way; he guesses that Cienzo has been
drawn into her snare, and goes to deliver him. He
makes his enchanted dog devour her, and frees his
brother, awakening him out of his sleep. Cienzo learning
that Meo had slept with his wife, cuts off his head;
but when he learns from his wife how Meo had divided
the sheets when he lay beside her, he bewails his rashness,
has recourse to the herb with which the dragon rubbed
itself when one of its heads had been cut off, and by this
means fastens Meo's head on to his body again.</p>

<p>The principal auxiliary, however, to one in particular
of the two brothers, as of the third in the legend of the
three brothers, is his horse.</p>

<p>When the hero devotes himself to the trade of thieving,
his most glorious achievement is robbing the king's horse.</p>

<p>When the young hero has been educated by the devil,
it is in the shape of a horse that he succeeds in escaping
from him.</p>

<p>When the solar hero fights, his greatest strength is in
his horse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>When the hero dies, his horse, too, is sacrificed.</p>

<p>Let us now illustrate, by some examples, these four
circumstances relative to the myth of the horse.</p>

<p>In the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>,<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> the god Indras appears in the
form now of a horseman, now of a horse. It is, moreover,
upon such a heroic horse that the young Utañkas
flees from the king of the serpents, after having recovered
from him the queen's earrings, which the king of the
serpents had stolen. In this legend reference is made to
several myths; to that of the hero in the infernal regions,
to that of the hero-thief, and to the legend of the horse
which saves the fugitive hero, the same as the hero who
leads away the horse.</p>

<p>In the <i>Vish&#7751;u P.</i>,<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> we have Kapilas, a form of Vish&#7751;us,
or of the solar hero (inasmuch as he is of a reddish
colour, or else of the evening sun), who carries off the
horse destined for the açvamedhas, that is to be sacrificed.
(In other words, the solar horse, the horse which
was meant for the sacrifice, escapes from it, in the same
way as, in the preceding chapter, we have seen the bull
escape into the forests.) In the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> the horse
destined for the sacrifice is, on the contrary, carried off
by a serpent (<i>i.e.</i>, the monster of night ravishes the evening
sun, whilst, in the western sky, the fire is being
prepared for his immolation). The sons of Sagaras (the
clouds of the heavenly ocean, the word <i>sagaras</i> meaning
sea), make a noise like thunder, searching for the horse
that had been carried off from them. They find it near
the god Vish&#7751;us or Kapilas (here the sun himself, the solar
horse itself, carried off into the cloudy ocean of night);
believing him to be the ravisher, they assail him; Kapilas
(or the solar horse), full of indignation, burns them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>ashes. Their nephew, A&#7749;sumant (he who is furnished
with rays, the radiant sun of morning), on the contrary,
delivers the horse out of the forest. In the evening
he is reconducted back to the place of sacrifice, on the
golden pavement, after having made the journey round
the world.<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> In the same way as we have seen, in the
preceding chapter, that the bull or the cow is touched or
struck as an augury of fruitfulness and abundance, in
the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> Kâuçalyâ touches the horse (a
stallion) in order to be fruitful, as he desires to have
sons (<i>putrakâmyayâ</i>), and the king and queen smell the
odour of the burnt marrow or fat of the horse, as a talisman
which may work for them the gratification of a
like wish.<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Of course we must always refer the legend
to the myth of the solar horse, which, even when sacrificed,
makes itself fruitful, so that it may rise again in
the morning in a new and young form. And we can
easily prove that the horse of the açvamedhas was a
mythical horse, since the açvamedhas was originally a
celestial ceremony, seeing we read in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>
how the swift heroic horse destined to be sacrificed was
born of the gods, and how the Vasavas had adorned it
with the colours of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> We saw a short time ago
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>how in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> itself it is now the Açvinâu, and
now Agnis who give the heroic steed to the predestined
youth. Agnis, moreover, who gives a horse to the hero,
is himself now a handsome red horse, and now an excellent
gh&#7771;idhnus,<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> a word which means the ravisher, as
well as the vulture (as a bird of prey). The thief plays
a principal part, even in the Vedic myths. In the war
between the demons and the gods, described at length in
the first book of the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, there is a continual
strife between the two sides as to who will show himself
the most skilful in stealing the cup which contains the
ambrosia. And the horse's head which, according to
Hindoo cosmogony, is born in the very production of
the ambrosia with the mythical gem, the horse's heads
of Dadhya&#324;&#263; and of Vish&#7751;us, which are found in the
ambrosia [through the mouth of which (Va&#7693;avamukhas)
it is necessary to pass in order to enter hell, where one
hears the cries and howls of the tormented, who inhabit
the water<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>], shows us how already in the myth the legend
of the theft of the earrings (the Açvinâu), or of the
queen's gem (the sun), or of the treasure, must be united
with the theft of the horse (the sun itself), as it seems to
be united in the legend of Utañkas, before quoted, in
which Utañkas flees upon the divine horse as he carries
away from hell the earrings of the queen, which another
skilful thief, the king of the serpents, had, in his turn,
stolen from him. (Herodotos already knew the story of
the skilful thief who robs the king's treasure and obtains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>the king's daughter to wife; he applies it to the king of
Egypt, Rampsinitos.)</p>

<p>When the stag, in the fable, flees in the forest, his
high horns betray him; when the bull flees, he fears
that his horns may betray the fugitives; even the mane
of the solar hero takes the name of horns. The Vedic hymn
describing the horse destined for the sacrifice, represents
it as having golden horns, and feet as rapid as thought
(like the stag), whose horns (or whose mane, like the
hair of the biblical Absalom, who revives again in the
legendary tradition of Mediæval Europe under an analogous
form), stretching here and there, are caught in the
trees of the forest.<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> Here, therefore, we have the swift-footed
animal, whose mane and horns are entangled to
the trees. Another Vedic hymn presents to us the hero
Tugras lost in the sea, who embraces a tree, and is saved
by means of it.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> In popular stories, the hero is often
saved upon a tree, either because the thieves or the bear
cannot see him, or because he is thus able to see the
horizon; the tree brings good luck to him, now because
by letting something drop or making a noise, he terrifies
the thieves, now because he cheats the cowherds, whose
cattle he wishes to possess himself of, by appearing now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>upon one tree, and now upon another; whereupon the
cowherds begin to dispute about his identity, one affirming
that it is the same person, another that it cannot be;
they therefore hastily go back to inspect the first tree,
and leave the cattle unguarded, upon which the hero-thief
descends from the tree, and drives them away before
him (this occurs in <i>Afanassieff</i>; the enemy of robbers is
generally himself an exceedingly skilful thief; Kereçâçpa
was no less a cunning thief than Mercury, the god of
robbers, who discovers the deceit of others, because he is
himself so expert a deceiver). In the nineteenth Mongol
story, which is of Hindoo origin, the young hero, after
having discharged his pious filial duties at the tomb of
his father, mounts a fiery horse, while he seizes the
branch of a tree. The tree is uprooted, and with it
the horse and the hero massacre the army of the king,
whose daughter the hero wishes to marry. In the
Russian story<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> which narrates the adventures of Little
Thomas Berennikoff, blind of an eye, the <i>miles gloriosus</i>,
Little Tom, after killing an army of flies, begins to boast
of the heroism he had shown in overthrowing, by himself,
a whole army of light cavalry. He meets with two real
heroes, Elias of Murom and Alexin Papovi&#263; (son of the
priest), who, on hearing him narrate his achievements,
immediately own and honour him as their elder brother.
The valour of the three is soon put to the proof; Elias
and Alexin show themselves to be true heroes; at last it
comes to Little Tom's turn to make proof of his valour;
he kills a hostile hero whilst his eyes are shut, and then
endeavours to ride his horse, but cannot. It is a hero's
horse, and can be ridden only by a hero. At length he
fastens the horse to an oak-tree, and climbs up the tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
in order to leap from it upon the horse's back. The
horse feels the man on his back, and plunges so much
that he roots up the whole tree, and drags it after him,
carrying Tom away into the heart of the Chinese army.
The Chinese are struck down by the oak-tree and
trodden under foot by the furious charger, and those who
are not killed are put to flight. (The mythical wooden
horse which proved so fatal to the Trojans appears to be
a mythical variety of this horse with the tree so fatal
to the Chinese.) The Emperor of China declares that
he will never make war again with a hero of Little Tom's
strength. Then the King of Prussia, an enemy of the
Chinese, gives, in gratitude to Tom, and as a reward for
his valour, his own daughter to wife. It is remarkable
that, in the course of the story, Alexin once observes to
Elias that the horse which Little Tom had brought from
his house showed none of the characteristic qualities of a
hero's horse. Alexin, as the priest's son, is the wise
hero; Elias, the strong one, who had conceived a high
opinion of his new colleague, Little Tom, seriously answers
that a hero's strength consists in himself, and not in his
horse. However, the development of the story shows
that Alexin was right; without the fiery horse of the
dead hero, Tom would not have dispersed the Chinese.</p>

<p>Thus, in a Vedic hymn,<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> we read that Indras, when he
removes himself from his two horses, becomes like to a
weak and wearied mortal; when he yokes them, he becomes
strong. The enemies in the battles cannot resist
the charge of the two fair-coloured horses of the god
Indras;<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> and not only this, but one part alone of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>divine horse is sometimes sufficient to give assurance of
victory to the hero-god. Another hymn<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> sings, "A
horse's tail wert thou then, O Indras;" that is, when
Indras vanquished the monster serpent. It is with the
head of the horse Dadhya&#324;&#263; that Indras discomfits his
enemies.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> The horse of the Açvinâu, which kills the
monster serpent, has already been referred to in these
pages. The solar horse Dadhikrâ, the same as Dadhya&#324;&#263;,
in another hymn of the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> is celebrated as a
swift falcon, luminous, impetuous, who destroys his
enemies like a hero-prince, who runs like the wind. His
enemies tremble, terrified by him, as by the thundering
sky; he fights against a thousand enemies&mdash;invincible,
formidable, and resplendent. Finally, the horses of the
god Agnis are said to vanquish the enemies with their
fore-feet.<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<p>When Añgadas wishes to fight with the monster
Narântakas, in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> he strikes with his fist
the head of his great and swift-footed horse, and then
with another blow he smites the monster in the chest, and
kills him.</p>

<p>In the seven adventures of Rustem, related by Firdusi,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>the hero's horse fights against the monster, and drives
him away, while the hero sleeps.</p>

<p>It is said of Bucephalus, the horse which Alexander the
Great alone was able to tame&mdash;so called because he had,
it would seem, on his head protuberances similar to the
horns of a bull (we saw not long since how the mane
of the solar horse is spoken of as horns in the Vedic
hymns)&mdash;that he several times saved Alexander in battle,
and that, though mortally wounded, in an engagement
in India, in the flank and head, he still summoned up
strength enough to flee away with extraordinary swiftness
and save his master, and then died. Pliny, quoting
Philarcus, says that when Antiochus was slain, the
warrior who had killed him endeavoured to ride his horse,
but that the latter threw him on the ground, and he
expired.</p>

<p>Of Pêgasos, the winged horse which bore the hero
Bellerophon over the waters, and by means of whom that
hero won his glorious victories, we know that the warrior-goddess
Pallas wore the effigy upon her helmet.</p>

<p>Suetonius writes of the horse of Julius Cæsar that it
had almost human feet, with toes ("pedibus prope
humanis, et in modum digitorum ungulis fissis"), from
which the aruspices prognosticated to Cæsar the empire
of the world; this horse, like Bucephalus, and every
heroic courser, would bear no other rider than its master&mdash;the
great conqueror.</p>

<p>The horse Baiardo, in <i>Ariosto</i>, fights the enemies with
its feet. The hippogriff of Ariosto has, moreover, the
privilege of being winged like Pêgasos, and of walking
on air, like the Tatos of the Hungarians. The name of
Falke, given to the horse of the Germanic and Scandinavian
hero Dietrich or Thidrek (Theodoricus), induces
us to believe that it too had the same winged nature.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>Edda</i>, Skirner receives from Frey a horse
which carried its rider through fogs (waters) and flames,
and the sword which strikes of itself when the wearer of
it happens to be a hero. The horse of Sigurd or Sîfrit
exhibits the same bravery in bearing the hero intact
through the flames. This happens in the morning, when
the sun emerges safe and sound from the flames of the
aurora; in the evening, on the contrary, when the sun
loses itself in the flames of the aurora, or when the solar
hero dies, his horse, too, like the horse of Balder in the
<i>Edda</i>, is burned upon the pyre or sacrificed; the resurrection
of the dead horse and that of the dead hero
happen at the same time. The horse's head which protrudes
out of the window, represented in ancient Hellenic
tombs, and preserved in Germanic customs,<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> is, for man,
a symbol of resurrection. The head of Vish&#7751;us, that of
U&#263;&#263;âi&#7717;çravas, and that of Dadhya&#324;&#263;, in Hindoo tradition,
have the same meaning. He who enters into this head
finds death and hell; he who comes out of it rises again
to new life. The pious Christian belief in the resurrection
that is to come, and the numerous mediæval legends
of Europe concerning dead heroes or maidens who are
resuscitated, had their origin and ground in the contemplation
of the annual and daily resurrection of the sun.</p>

<p>In the thirty-eighth story of the fifth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,
the young prince receives from an enchanted bird
the present of a war-charger, and of an apple the colour of
the sun. (The youth gives the golden apple to a beautiful
princess for the pleasure of passing the night with her;
remark here, again, the relation of the horse and the apple,
and probably of the horse and the bull, the sun and moon).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
In other Russian stories, the horse of the hero, Ivan Tzarevi&#263;,
is at first bound underground by twelve iron chains; when
Ivan rides him, he breaks them all.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> The horse which Ivan
the thief is told to carry off from his master<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> is shut up
within three gates made fast by six bolts; if he steals it,
he is to receive a reward of 200 roubles; and if he does
not, 200 bastinadoes will be his punishment. Ivan takes
his master's clothes, disguises himself as a gentleman,
and, imitating his voice, orders the grooms to bring him
his favourite horse. The grooms are deceived, and obey,
and thus Ivan carries the horse off. Finally, in a third
Russian story,<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Ivan Tzarevi&#263; must ride a hero's horse on
the occasion of his nuptials with the beautiful but wicked
Anna. He has recourse to his preceptor Katoma, surnamed
Hat of Oak (here we find again the hero in
relation with the tree and the horse), who orders the
blacksmith to prepare a hero's horse; twelve young
blacksmiths (the twelve hours of the night, or else the
twelve months of the year) draw twelve bolts, open
twelve doors, and lead out an enchanted horse, bound
with twelve iron chains. Scarcely has the preceptor
mounted on its back when it flies higher than the forest
which stays still, and lower than the cloud which moves.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
The preceptor subdues it by taking hold of its mane with
one hand, and striking it with the other between the
ears with four pieces, one after another, of an enchanted
iron pillar. The horse then begs, with a man's voice, for
its life, the power of speech being a distinctive attribute
of the hero's horse (a power of which it often makes use,
as Rustem's horse does, for instance, to warn the hero of
the dangers which surround him, and to give him good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>advice; sometimes, on the contrary, when it is in the
monster's power, it plays the part of a spy upon the hero's
actions, and reports them to the monster);<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> it promises
also to do the will of the preceptor. Katoma, calling the
horse dog's flesh, orders it to stay still the next day,
which is the day fixed for the wedding, and, when the
bridegroom Ivan is to ride it, to seem as though it were
oppressed by a great weight.</p>

<p>In the seventh Esthonian story, the young hero steals
the horse from the master (the devil, or the black monster
of night) in whose service he had engaged himself. When
he comes to the place where the sun sets, he bethinks
himself of binding the horse with iron chains (the rope
of Yamas, or Varu&#7751;as, the nocturnal coverer or binder,
which binds the Vedic hero Çuna&#7717;çepas, the sun, he of
the golden rod), in order that it may not escape and go
back again. This particular is very interesting, as rendering
the meaning of the myth more manifest. Seeing
that the sun, in the evening, does not return, it was supposed
that the solar horse had been bound by the hero
himself, who had stolen it.</p>

<p>In the European popular tales we sometimes have,
instead of the hero who carries off his master's horse, the
hero himself, who escapes from his master in the form of
a horse, helped in his flight by the daughter of his master,
by the magician's or demon's daughter or black maiden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
(who afterwards becomes beautiful and luminous). In
the Hungarian belief, the youngest of the witch's daughters
(the aurora) often assumes the form of the heroic
horse of the Tatos. She becomes Tatos when the hero,
meeting her, strikes her on the forehead with the bridle;
then she carries him, in the shape of a horse, into the air.
In the Russian story,<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> the son of a merchant goes to be
instructed by a wise magician, who teaches him every
kind of knowledge, and, among the rest, what sheep say
when they bleat, birds when they sing, and horses when
they neigh. At last the young man, having learned
every species of mischief, returns home and transforms
himself into a horse, in order that his father may sell him
at the market and make money; but he warns his father
not to give up the bridle, that he may not fall again into
the hands of the magician. The father forgets, and sells
horse and bridle together. The magician attaches the
horse by a ring to an oak-tree; the black maiden
(dievki &#263;ernavke), the sister of the devil, gives the horse
millet and hydromel; the horse thus gains strength
enough to break the chain which binds him to the tree,
and escapes. The devil follows him; the horse becomes
a fish, and from a fish a ring; the king's daughter buys
the ring and puts it on her finger; during the day it is a
ring (the solar disc), and during the night a handsome
youth, who lies in the bed of the queen's daughter (the
hidden sun, or the moon, in the darkness of night). One
day the princess lets the ring fall on the ground, and it
breaks into a thousand pieces (the evening sun which falls
upon the mountain); then the devil becomes a cock, to
pick up the pieces of the broken ring; but a little piece falls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
under the princess's foot; this piece is transformed into
a falcon, which strangles and devours the cock.</p>

<p>In the bridle which binds this hero who becomes a
horse, I think I can recognise the lasso with which Varu&#7751;as
keeps Çuna&#7717;çepas bound in the <i>Âitareya Br.</i> In the
<i>&#7770;igvedas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> we have Sûryas, the sun, as Sâuvaçvyas, or
son of Svaçvyas, that is, of him who has fine horses; but
as, besides Svaçvyas, we find Svaçvas, he who has a fine
horse, the sun itself would seem to be this horse. The
legend narrates that Svaçvas, having no children, requested
the sun to give him some, and that the sun, to
please him, was himself born of him. Svaçvas, he who
has a fine horse and has no sons, is perhaps the same as
the old man who has lost his son by selling the horse;
when the sun returns his son also comes back again. In
the Vedic expressions, <i>without a horse, born without a
bridle, the sun</i> (as a courser<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>), the hero would seem to be
indicated who has not as yet that horse or that bridle,
without which he is powerless; for the idea of the hero
is rarely unaccompanied by that of the horseman.</p>

<p>For the horseman hero his horse is his all, and sometimes
it even takes the bit in its mouth, then the hero
punishes it. We have already noticed the well-known
Hellenic myth of Phaethôn, who is, with both the chariot
and the horses, precipitated into the waters, because the
horses threatened to set the earth on fire. This happens
every day towards evening, when the sun sets; the whole
sky goes down, then the sun is thrown down into the
ocean of night; the course of the solar steeds is interrupted,
and the wheels of the chariot no longer turn. A
similar catastrophe is repeated on St John's Day, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>summer solstice, in which the sun stops and begins to
retire, for which reason the light of day, from this time
to Christmas, grows less and less.</p>

<p>It is a custom on St John's Day, in Germany,<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> for
hunters to fire at the sun, believing that they will thereby
become infallible hunters. According to another
popular German belief, he who, on St John's Day, fires
towards the sun is condemned ever after to hunt for ever,
like Odin, the eternal hunter; and both superstitions
have their reason. In the night, as well as in the period
during which the splendour of the sun diminishes, and
especially in autumn, the gloomy forest of heaven is
filled with every kind of ferocious animal; the sun enters
this forest, becomes moon, and hunts the wild beasts in it
during the whole of the night, or of the year that is, until
he is born again. In the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, where we have seven
sister-mares yoked to the sun-chariot,<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> Indras, to please
his favourite, Etaças, after having drunk the ambrosia,
pushes the clouds that had fallen behind before the flying
steeds of the sun,<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> that is to say, he prevents the solar
hero, drawn by horses, either by the cloud in a tempest,
or by the darkness of night, from going on; and he even
strikes the wheels themselves of the solar chariot to arrest
its incendiary course. From these Vedic data it is easy
to pass to the Hellenic Phaethôn, who is precipitated
into the waters on account of the horses. The hero
killed on account of his horses is a frequent subject of
mythology, and the Greek name Hippolytos refers to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>kind of death. Hippolytos, the son of Theseus, fleeing
from his father, who supposes him guilty of incest with
his step-mother Phedra, is thrown from the chariot broken
to pieces, when the horses that draw it approach the sea
and are terrified by marine monsters. This is a variation
of the legend of the young hero, persecuted by his step-mother,
who is thrown into the sea, with the novel and
remarkable accompaniment that it is his horses themselves
which are the cause of his death. The Christian
legend of St Hippolytos has appropriated this particular
trait, representing the holy martyr, who was prefect under
the emperors Decius and Valerian, as dying, having been
condemned to be torn in pieces by horses. The poet
Prudentius comments upon the story in these two curious
distichs, on the occasion of the Roman judge pronouncing
capital punishment against St Hippolytos&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>But the horses which draw the hero into the water are
the same as those that save him by carrying him over
the deep, drawing the chariot or ship on the sea towards
the shore. The Açvinâu do the same in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>,
where they save from the waves both themselves and
other heroes upon their chariot, which is compared to a
ship.<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> Hero and horse always have the same fate.</p>

<p>When the hero approaches, or when some fortunate
incident is about to happen to the hero, his horse neighs
for joy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
In the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> on the arrival of the god Indras, the
horse neighs, the cow lows, like a messenger between
heaven and earth. The neighing of this horse, and the
lowing of this cow, are the thundering of the sun in the
cloud. By this neighing or lowing, man is informed that
the hero-god Indras is beginning his battles in heaven.
Another hymn, which calls the two horses of Indras
two rays of the sun (sûryasya ketû), celebrates them as
neighing and pouring out ambrosia,<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> <i>i.e.</i>, the sun makes
rain fall from the clouds; when he shows himself in the east
at morn, his horse neighs and drops the dew on the ground.</p>

<p>Herodotus, and, after him, Oppianos and Valerius
Maximus, relate the mythical story of Darius Hystaspes,
who unexpectedly succeeded to the empire from having
persuaded his colleagues to decree that he should obtain
the crown whose horse happened first to neigh at the
sight of the sun. It is narrated that when he came to
the place, Darius, in order to assure himself of success,
made his horse smell the odour of a mare.<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> Neighing is
the laughter of the horse. We have seen, in the preceding
chapter, how the bull speaks and the fish laughs at
sight of coition; and so we have here, in the story of
Darius, the horse who neighs on account of the mare.&mdash;To
return to the horse of mythology; the solar horse neighs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>within the thundering-cloud which, as a cow, the bull
makes pregnant, and as a mare, the stallion, and neighs
at the approach of the aurora, who appears now as the
driver of a hundred chariots<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> (a round number, like the
hundred thousand horses which, in another hymn,<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> the
god Indras drives; a favourite number, like seven, which
is applied to the same solar horses, solar rays and
Añgirasas<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>)&mdash;on which account it can be compared with
the Hellenic Aphroditê Hippodameia&mdash;now even as a real
mare. The sun is now a driver of horses, and now himself
a horse; in the same way, the aurora is now an Amazon
horsewoman, now a driver of chariots, now açvâvatî,
and now a mare. When the sun approaches the aurora,
or when the horse approaches the mare, the horse neighs.
We know how the Açvinâu considered themselves sons
of the wife of the sun, Sara&#7751;yû, daughter of Tvash&#7789;ar,
who united herself to the sun in the form of a mare.
Whether this Sara&#7751;yû be the cloud or the aurora, we
have in her, anyhow, a mare with which the sun, solar
hero, or solar horse, unites himself to produce the twin
heroes, who are, for this reason, also called the two sons
of the mare.<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> We have already seen, in the preceding
chapter, a hero and a heroine who are hatched from eggs;
of the Dioscuri, we know that they were born of the egg
of Leda; and the mare's egg is the subject of a story in
the <i>Ukermark</i>.<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> Greek writers have handed down several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>cases of coition between men and mares, and between
horses and women, with corresponding births of monstrous
conformation. Now, unnatural as such births must
appear to us, they are, in mythology, in strict accordance
with nature. In the preceding chapter we saw the cow
which leaps over the hare, and explained this phenomenon
by the cloud or darkness covering the moon, and also by
the earth covering the moon in eclipses. In Herodotus
and Valerius Maximus, a mare, in the time of Xerxes,
gives birth to a hare; and we must here understand the
hare to be the moon, coming out of the darkness or clouds;
and when we read that the hare suffocated the mare,
we must understand it to mean the moon as dispersing
the darkness or clouds (perhaps also the sun or evening
aurora). We must have recourse in this way to the
myth to comprehend the examples of parturition without
coition found in some Hindoo legends, and applied
to heroes, as well as the curious discussions and information
which we find in the ancients, from Aristotle, Varro,
Pliny, Columella, Solinus, and St Augustin, to Albertus
Magnus and Aldrovandi, concerning mares, and especially
Spanish and Portuguese mares, made pregnant by
the wind (called by Oppianos<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> of the windy feet), and
which are also spoken of in the <i>Pentamerone</i>,<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> with less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>decency, in reference to the myth of the maiden born of
the tree.</p>

<p>The horse of Ariosto, too, has a similar nature&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Questo è il destrier che fu dell' Argalia<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Che di fiamma e di vento era concetto<br /></span>
<span class="i1">E senza fieno e biada si nutria<br /></span>
<span class="i1">De l'aria pura e Rabican fu detto."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The horse of Ciolle, in a Tuscan proverb, also feeds
upon wind alone.</p>

<p>The horse of Dardanos, son of Zeus, was also said to
be born of the wind, which brings us back to the Vedic
Marutas, whose chariots have horses for wings, and to
the <i>volucer currus</i> of the Diespiter of Horace.<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> In the
Sansk&#7771;it tongue, the expression <i>vâtâçvas</i>, or wind-horse,
is very common, to indicate a very swift-footed horse.</p>

<p>No sooner is the horse U&#263;&#263;âi&#7717;çravas born than he
neighs; and like him, in the <i>Mahâbhâratam</i>, the hero
Açvatthâman laughs, the son of Dro&#7751;as, properly he who
has strength in his horse, which is the same as the hero-horse.</p>

<p>Moreover, as the horse exults by neighing over the
good fortune of the hero who rides him, so he not only
becomes sad, but sheds real tears when his rider is about
to meet with misfortune.</p>

<p>When Râva&#7751;as, in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, comes forth in
his chariot, to join in final combat with Râmas, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
coursers shed tears,<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> as a sinister omen, Râvanas is the
monster of darkness and clouds; when the cloud begins
to disperse, drops of rain fall, that is, the horses of the
monster weep. The treacherous sister who is confederate
with the monster against her brother, in Russian stories,
is condemned by her brother, who kills the monster, to
fill a whole basin with her tears.<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> These tears are also a
legendary symbol of the rain which falls when the solar
hero has torn the cloud in two.</p>

<p>Suetonius, in the Life of Cæsar, writes that the horses
consecrated by Cæsar to Mars, and then set at liberty
after the passage of the Rubicon, refused to eat, and
wept abundantly.<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> Note that this legend of the horses
that weep is connected with the passage of water, of the
Rubicon (a river which no geographer has been able to
identify with certainty, probably because the legend of
Cæsar relating to it is a fable of mythical origin. We
know how mythical beliefs incline to assume a human
form, and are especially prone to group themselves round
the great personages of history&mdash;Cyrus, Alexander,
Romulus, Cæsar, Augustus, Vespasian, Attila, Theodoric,
and Charlemagne are proofs of this; and perhaps a day
will come in which Napoleon I. or Garibaldi will offer
a new <i>mannequin</i> to some popular tradition, which
is now uncertain and wandering). Thus it is said that
Cæsar's horse itself shed tears for three days before the
hero's death. In the <i>Iliad</i>,<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> the horses of Achilleus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>weep for the death of Patroklos, whom Hektor has
thrown from his chariot into the dust; in the <i>Paraleipomenoi</i>
of Quintus Smyrneus,<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> the horses of Achilleus
weep bitterly for the death of their hero. This is a
variety of the legend of the horses which throw the solar
hero down into the waters, the ocean of night or the
clouds, and of that of the horses of Poseidôn. The mists
which after sunset in the evening impregnate the air, and
the diurnal or nocturnal rains, as well as the autumnal
ones, cause tears to fall upon the ground, or weep over
the (apparent) death of the solar hero.</p>

<p>The dew of the morning, on the contrary, which
comes from the mouth of the solar horse like foam, or
from its hoof as ambrosia and salutary water, is fraught
with every species of healthful influence.</p>

<p>The horse and the bull of mythology are pourers out
<i>par excellence</i>. In a Vedic strophe&mdash;which seems in my
eyes to be one of those riddles which are recited in order
to loosen the thread of the tongue&mdash;relative to the two
outpouring or fertilising horses of Indras, there is a continual
play kept up upon the root <i>varsh</i> or <i>v&#7771;ish</i>, which
means at once to pour out and to make fruitful,<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> and upon
the letter <i>r</i> which enters into almost every word of the
verse. Not only do the horses of Indras pour out and
make fruitful; the same virtue is attributed to the
chariot which they draw.<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> We have seen already that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>the horse of the Açvinâu is the killer of the monster
serpent, and that the horse's head Dadhya&#324;&#263;, he who
goes in the milk or in the liquefied butter, and who is
found in a sea of milk, discomfits the enemies of Indras.
A Vedic hymn sings that, with the foam of the waters,
Indras beats down the head of the monster serpent.<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>
In Tuscany, the whooping-cough is called the horse-cough
or asinine-cough,<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> and it is thought that the
cough is cured by giving the children to drink the foam
from the horse's mouth, or causing them to drink in the
water where a horse has been drinking. This is a
remedy founded upon the principle <i>similia similibus</i>, the
foam being used against the convulsive cough, which,
like all convulsions in general, brings much saliva or
foam to the mouth. The credit, however, of this marvellous
medicine is slightly compromised when we read
that the same foam is also very efficacious for ear-ache.
Pliny, Sextus Empiricus, and Marcellus, quoted by
Aldrovandi,<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> also recommend the saliva of a horse as a
cure for cough, particularly in the case of consumptive
patients, adding that the sick person is cured in three
days, but that the horse dies; a superstition which must
have had its origin in the mythical horse who feeds on
ambrosia, and who loses his strength, and expires when
his saliva, foam, ambrosia, or dew is taken from him.
It is well known that the Açvinâu, besides being
luminous horsemen, were, as friends of men, also exceedingly
skilful physicians; nor could they be otherwise,
having in their power the head of Dadhya&#324;&#263; which is in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>the ambrosia, that is, whose foam is ambrosia. The
Dioscuri also frequently appear, in European legends,
as unexpected and miraculous deliverers. With this
mythical belief of the horse that produces ambrosia, is
also connected the transformation, described by Ovid in
the second book of the <i>Metamorphoses</i>, of Ocyroe into a
mare, because she had predicted that Æsculapius would
save men from death by the medical art. It is a well-known
fact that Æsculapius was revered near fountains
whose waters were supposed to have salutary effects,
and that he was protected by the sun-god Apollo; and
the two physicians, sons of Asklêpios or Æsculapius,
seem to be nothing more than a specific form of the
Dioscuri.</p>

<p>But the solar horse does not produce ambrosia with
his mouth alone.</p>

<p>He has great strength in his hoofs (whence Isidorus
and other mediæval etymologists derived the name
<i>caballus</i>, thus, "Quod ungula terram cavet"<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>), and
makes use of them in the myth, and in the legend, not
only to combat the enemies, but also to break open the
earth, and cause ambrosial fountains to spring out of it.
Sometimes ambrosia pours out of the hoof of the horse
itself. In the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> the horses of Agnis are said to
have hands (<i>i.e.</i>, hoofs of the fore-feet) that pour out;
and the horse given by the Açvinâu to the hero protected
by them (that is, to the solar horse, to the
morning sun), with his strong hoof fills a hundred jars
with inebriating liquor.<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> It is not necessary for me to
instance here the famous fountain of the horse, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>Hippokrênê, which Bellerophon's horse Pêgasos caused
to spring out of the earth by breaking the soil with his
hoof (called also for this reason <i>Pêgasía krênê</i>). In
Latin tradition, the horse's hoof was worshipped on a
spot near Lake Regillus, where it is said that the
Dioscuri had appeared.<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> In a Russian story,<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> when
Johnny (Ivanushka) sees a horse's hoof, he is sorely
tempted to drink out of it, but is dissuaded by his
sister. He experiences the same temptation upon seeing
a bull's hoof, and afterwards that of a kid. At last he
gives way, drinks from the kid's hoof, and is himself
transformed into a kid. In the footprint of a horse's
hoof, in other stories, the ant is in danger of being
drowned; saved by a man, it is ever afterwards grateful
to him.<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<p>Several myths which we have already noticed in the
preceding chapter as applied to the bull, occur again in
connection with the horse; as, for instance, the birds
which come out of the horse; the hero who takes the
horse's skin off, seizing it by the tail in order to make a
sack of it; the swift horse of Adrastus, which runs after
the tortoise (a Greek proverb);<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> the lunar horse, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>the solar one. These exchanges between moon and sun,
and between bull and horse, are happily indicated by
the Latin poet, Fulgentius:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jam Ph&#339;bus disjungit equos, jam Cynthia jungit,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Quasque soror liquit, frater pede temperat undas:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Tum nox stellato c&#339;lum circumlita peplo<br /></span>
<span class="i1">C&#339;rula rorigenis pigrescere jusserat alis<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Astrigeroque nitens diademate luna bicornis<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bullarum bijugis conscenderat æquora tauris."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The gods had often a liking to transform themselves
into horses; so much so, that the sacrifice of the god,
that is, the god's death, is represented by the death of
the horse. Every one knows that gods and heroes
delighted in showing themselves good horsemen, or, at
least, good charioteers. On this account, it would be
difficult to say to which god in particular the horse is
sacred. The Vedic Açvinâu, the Vedic aurora, who
wins the race in her chariot, Agnis, Savitar, Indras,
victorious and splendid by means of their steeds, the
hippios Poseidôn, the hippeia Athênê, the hippodameia
Aphroditê, the horsemen Dioscuri, Mars, Apollo, Zeus,
Pluto, and the German Wuotan (like his <i>alter ego</i>, St
Zacchæus), never show themselves otherwise than on
horseback; hence the horse was naturally sacred to all
of them. In the Christian faith, the innumerable gods
of the ancients having become innumerable saints (when
they were not so unfortunate as to degenerate into
devils), the horse is now recommended in its stable to
the protection of several saints, from the obscure Sicilian
St Aloi to the no less modest Russians St Froh and St<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
Laver, who take the horse, as well as the mule and the
ass, under their especial protection, not to speak of the
glorious horsemen St George, St Michael, St James, St
Maurice, St Stephen, St Vladimir, and St Martin,
especially revered by warriors, and in whose honour the
principal orders of knighthood in Europe were founded.
But religions being, from one point of view, the caricature
of mythologies, there is now some difference between
the mythical old deities and the legendary new ones, inasmuch
as the former would at times ingenuously accept
the homage of the animal in effigy, as we have observed
in the preceding chapter; while the latter, and they who
purvey to them upon earth, not being quite so simple,
never leave their devotee in peace until they have
received, at sight and without discount, the full value of
their favours. In the Life of San Gallo, we read that, in
the times of King Pepin (we already know what these
times mean), a certain Willimar, being ill, promised, if
cured, to offer a horse to the Church of San Gallo.
Having recovered his health, he forgot his promise; but
passing one day before the church of the saint, his horse
stopped before the gate, and by no possibility could it be
induced to-move on, until Willimar had at last declared
his intention of fulfilling his vow. In the Life of St
Martin, there is a rather gayer variation of the same
anecdote. King Clodoveus, after having become a Christian,
when fighting against the Visigoths, promises his
own horse to St Martin, if he grants the victory to him.
Having obtained it, Clodoveus regrets being obliged to
deprive himself of his good charger, and beseeches St
Martin to be kind enough to take money instead,
offering him a hundred pieces of gold. St Martin
thinks the sum insufficient, and asks for double, which
Clodoveus gives; but, inasmuch as a little heretic blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
still runs in his veins, he cannot refrain from aiming a
pointed witticism at him: "Martinus, quantum video,
auxiliator est facilis, sed mercator difficilis!"<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>The ass, in Europe at least, has had the misfortune to
have been born under an evil star, a circumstance which
must be reckoned to the account of the Greeks and
Romans, whose humour it was to treat it as a sort of
Don Quixote of animals. Its liability to be flogged has
always increased with its celebrity, which, no one can
deny, is great and indefeasible. The poor ass has paid
very dear, and continues to pay still dearer, upon earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
for the flight which the fantasy of primeval men made
it take in the mythical heavens. May this chapter&mdash;if it
produce no other effect&mdash;have at least that of sparing the
poor calumniated animal some few of the many blows
which, given in fun, it is accustomed to receive, as if to
afford a vent for the satirical humour of our race, and <i>ad
exhilarandam caveam</i>.</p>

<p>The germ of the reputation the ass has of being both a
stupid and a petulant animal, acquired in Greece and in
Italy, spreading thence into all the other parts of Europe,
may already be found in the ancient myths of the
Hindoos. Professor Weber,<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> however, has proved, in
answer to Herr Wagener, that the idea of a stupid and
presumptuous ass, such as we always find it represented in
the fables of the <i>Pa&#324;&#263;atantram</i>, was diffused in India by the
Greeks, and is not indigenous to Hindoo faith and literature.</p>

<p>In India, the ass was not a particular object of ridicule;
and this was perhaps for the simple reason that the
Eastern varieties of the asinine family are far handsomer
and nobler than the Western ones. The ass in the East
is generally ardent, lively, and swift-footed, as in the
West it is generally slow and lazy, having no real energy
except of a sensual nature. For if even the West (and
especially the south of Europe) possesses a distinct species
of ass, which reminds us of the <i>multinummus</i> ass of Varro
(in the same way as the East also, though exceptionally,
has inferior varieties), the asinine multitude in Europe
is composed of animals of a low type and a down-trodden
appearance, and it is against them that our jests and our
floggings are especially directed. This is the proverbial
ass's kick against the fallen; the poor outcast of the West<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
dearly pays the penalty of the honours conceded to his
illustrious mythical ancestors of the East. We think
that the ass of which we hear heroic achievements related
is the same as that which now humbly carries the
pack; and since we no longer regard him as capable of a
magnanimous action, we suppose that he (unfortunate
animal!) appropriates to himself all these ancient glories
out of vain presumption, for which reason there is no
affront which we do not feel entitled to offer to him.
Nor did Christianity succeed in delivering him from
persecution,&mdash;Christianity, which, as it represents the Sun
of nations, the Redeemer of the world, as born between
the two musical animals, the ox and the ass (who were
to prevent His cries from being heard), and introduces
the ass as the saviour of the Divine Child persecuted
during the night, and as the animal ridden by Christ, in
his last entry into Jerusalem, invested him with more than
one sacred title which ought from its devotees to have
procured for him a little more regard. Unfortunately, the
same famous mediæval ecclesiastical hymn which was sung
in France on the 14th of January in honour of the ass,
richly caparisoned near the altar, to celebrate the flight
into Egypt, was turned into a satire. It must have been
not without some gay levity that priest and people exclaimed
"Hinham!" three times after the conclusion of
the mass, on the day of the festival of the ass.<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> Nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
did the inhabitants of Empoli show him more reverence,
when, on the eighth day after the festival of the <i>Corpus
Domini</i>&mdash;that is, near the summer solstice&mdash;they made
him fly in the air, amid the jeers of the crowd; nor the
Germans, who, in Westphalia, made the ass a symbol of
the dull St Thomas, who was the last of the apostles to
believe in the resurrection. The Westphalians were
accustomed to call by the name of "the ass Thomas" (as
in Holland he is called "luilak") the boy who on St
Thomas's Day was the last to enter school.<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> On Christmas
Day, in the Carnival, on Palm-Sunday, and in the
processions which follow the festival of <i>Corpus Domini</i>,<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>the Church often introduced the ass into her ceremonies,
but more in order to exhilarate the minds of her devotees
than to edify them by any suggestion of the virtues it
represents in the Gospels; so that, notwithstanding the
great services rendered by the ass to the Founder of the
new religion, he not only received no benefit in return
from Christianity, but became instead the unfortunate
object of new attentions, which rather depressed than
heightened his already sufficiently degraded social condition.</p>

<p>And so the Greeks and Romans first, and the Catholic
priests afterwards, combined, by their treatment of him, to
make the ass more indifferent than he would otherwise
have been to the passion and spirited struggle for life
shown in all the other animals. He was perhaps intended
for a higher fate, if man had not come upon earth, and
interfered too persistently to thwart his vocation. And
probably his race gradually deteriorated, just because,
having become ridiculous, few cared to preserve or increase
his nobleness. As the proverb said that it was useless
to wash the ass's head, so it seemed useless for man to
endeavour to ameliorate or civilise his form: the physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
decadence of the ass was contemporary and parallel with
his decline morally.</p>

<p>But although it was in Greece and Rome that the
poor ass was thrown completely down from his rank in the
animal kingdom, the first decree of his fall was pronounced
in his ancient Asiatic abode. Let us prove this.</p>

<p>In the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, the ass already appears under two
different aspects&mdash;one divine and the other demoniacal&mdash;to
which may perhaps be added a third intermediate or
gandharvic aspect.</p>

<p>In the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, the ass has the names of <i>gardabhas</i>
and <i>râsabhas</i>; in Sansk&#7771;it, also those of <i>kharas, &#263;akrîvant,
&#263;iramehin</i>, and <i>bâleyas</i>.</p>

<p>It is important to notice how each of these designations
tends to lapse into ambiguity; and ambiguity in
words plays a considerable part in the formation of myths
and popular beliefs.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the most modern designations.</p>

<p><i>Bâleyas</i> may mean the childish one (from <i>bâlas</i> = child,
and stupid<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>), as well as the demoniacal (from
<i>balis</i>; and indeed, besides being a name given to the
ass, <i>bâleyas</i> is also a name for a demon).</p>

<p><i>&#262;iramehin</i> is the ass as <i>longe mingens</i> (a quality which
can apply to the ass, but still more so to the rainy cloud).</p>

<p><i>&#262;akrîvant</i> means he who is furnished with wheels,
with round objects or testicles (an epithet equally applicable
to the ass and his phallos).</p>

<p><i>Kharas</i> signifies he who cries out, as well as the ardent
one (and <i>kharus</i>, which ought to have the same meaning,
signifies, according to the Petropolitan Dictionary, foolish,
and horse; perhaps ass too).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
<i>Râsabhas</i> is derived from the double root <i>ras</i>, whence
<i>rasa</i> = humour, juice, water, savour, sperm, and <i>râsa</i> = din,
tumultuous noise.</p>

<p><i>Gardabhas</i> comes from the root <i>gard</i>,<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a> to resound, to
bellow; but I think I can recognise in the word <i>gardabhas</i>
the same meaning as <i>gandharbas</i> or <i>gandharvas</i>, and
<i>vice versa</i>. The <i>gardabhas</i> explains to me how the
<i>gandharvas</i> was conceived to be a musician; and the
<i>gandharvas</i> (a word which, I repeat, seems to me composed
of <i>gandha</i> + <i>arvas</i>, developed out of a hypothetic
<i>&#7771;ivas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> that is, he who walks in the unguent, or he who
goes in the perfume) helps me to understand the proverb,
"Asinus in unguento," and the corresponding legends.
The equivocal word <i>râsabhas</i>, in its two meanings, seems
to unite together the sonorous <i>gardabhas</i> with the <i>gandharbas</i>
who likes perfumes, or the <i>gandharvo apsu</i> (<i>gandharvas</i>
in the waters) of the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> the guardian of
the ambrosial plant.<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> The mythical ass and the Vedic
<i>gandharvas</i> have the same qualities and the same instincts.
The gandharvâs, for instance, are represented
in the <i>Âitareya Br.</i> as lovers of women,<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> so much so
that for a woman's sake they allow themselves to be
deprived of the ambrosia (or somas); and it is also known
from the story of Urvaçî how jealous they are of their
nymphs, the <i>apsarâs</i>, or them who flow by on the waters
(the clouds), and from the story of Hanumant, in the
<i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, how greedy they are of their salutary herbs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>and waters.<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> The mythical and legendary ass also has a
foible for beautiful maidens; it is unnecessary to give the
reason of this belief.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> When Circe wishes to give, by means
of an unguent, an ass's head to Odysseus, we find an
allusion to the loves of the ass and the beautiful woman.
When the Lucius of Apuleius, while endeavouring to
change himself into a bird (another of the names by
which the phallos is indicated), becomes instead, by
means of the woman's unguent, an ass, the ass is another
name for the phallical bird. And as the Vedic ass
delights in the <i>rasas</i>, or humour, water or sperm (the
two words <i>râsas</i> and <i>rasas</i>, derived from a common root,
being easily interchangeable); as the mythical ass, when
it finds the ambrosia of the roseate morning aurora, once
more becomes the splendid young sun; so the ass of
Apuleius, too, becomes Lucius again, or the luminous
and handsome youth that he was before, as soon as he
has an opportunity of feeding upon roses: he becomes an
ass for love of a woman, and regains his splendour in the
rosy aurora. During the night, being subject to the
enchantment of a beautiful fairy, the hero remains an
ass; and in the form of an ass, and under an ass's skin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>he carries the priap&#339;an mysteries, whence the expression
of Aristophanes in the <i>Frogs</i>, "The ass which carries
mysteries" (onos agôn müstêria), the same mysteries as
the Phallagia or Perifallia of Rome. In the Christian
myth, this mystery is the flight of the new-born Divine
Child into Egypt;<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> in the story of Perrault, it is the
beautiful maiden, the evening aurora, the girl persecuted
by her father and would-be seducer, who disguises herself
during the night with an ass's skin;<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> the beautiful
girl evidently transfers her erotic sympathies to the ass
that loves her. Of loves such as these,&mdash;of an ass with a
maiden, or of the young hero and an ass,&mdash;are born the
monstrous onokentaurs and Empusa, now a beautiful
maiden, and now the terrifier of children, who is represented
with ass's feet, because her mother was an ass, and
her father, Aristoxenes, enamoured of an ass. It is now the
evening aurora, now the dying sun, and now both, who,
under the cloud of night, or in winter, are represented as
covered with an ass's skin. Professor Kuhn has already
proved the close affinity, amounting to identity, between
the gandharvâs and the Hellenic kentauroi, both of
which come before us in connection with the inebriating
drink; but the kentauros is essentially a hippokentauros,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>or, still better, an onokentauros,<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> or centaur ass. The
fable of Cupid and Psyche in Apuleius, in its relation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
with the story of the ass, perfectly agrees with the analogous
Hindoo fable of the loves of Purûravas and
Urvaçî, united with the story of the Gandharvâs. Peau
d'âne, Psyche, and Urvaçî are therefore mythical sisters.</p>

<p>Professor Kuhn's proof of the identity of the gandharvas
and the kentauros being admitted, the identity
of the gardabhas with the gandharbas, and of the ass
with the gandharvas, seems to follow as a natural consequence.
The myth of the kentauros, either hippokentauros
or onokentauros, no less than the myth of the
gandharvas, corresponds entirely with that of the ass.
The kentauros loves wine and women; he plays the lyre
upon the car of Dionysos in conjunction with satyrs,
nymphs, and bacchantes; he teaches on Mount Pelion
music,<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> the science of health, and the prophetic art to the
Dioscuri, which are all subjects that occur again with
slight modifications in the Hindoo legends concerning
the gandharvâs, and in the fable of the ass, as we shall
prove hereafter.&mdash;But to return to the Hindoo myth; in
the same way as the gandharvâs has a hybrid nature, and
shows himself at one time in the aspect of a demi-god, at
another in that of a semi-demon, so the mythical ass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
India has now a divine nature, and now a human. The
gandharvas is the guardian of riches and waters: inasmuch
as he defends them from the demoniacal robbers,
preserves them from mortals, and distributes them among
the pious, he appears under a beneficent and divine
aspect; inasmuch, on the other hand, as he carries them
off and keeps them shut up like a miser, he resembles
the monster that is fabled to guard fountains and treasures,
the demon who keeps the waters shut up, the thieves
who gather treasures together, and the devil, the master
of all riches. For the same reason we already find in
Hindoo tradition the beneficent ass and his evil-doing congener.
The sun (sometimes the moon also) in the cloud
and the darkness of night is the same as the treasure in
the cavern, the treasure in hell, and the hero or heroine
in the gloomy forest; and this cavern and hell sometimes
assume the form of an ass's skin, or of an ass simply.
That which comes out of the cloud, and of the gloom,
also comes out of the ass; the soul of the ass is the sun,
or the hero or heroine, or the riches which he conceals.
The Açvinâu are often found in connection with the
worthless horse, which afterwards becomes handsome by
means of the ambrosia itself that the horse produces; the
gandharvâs, a more nocturnal and cloudy form, if I may
use the expression, of the solar or lunar hero, are in near
relation with the ass, their <i>alter ego</i>, who enjoys the blessing
of eternal youth. The Açvinâu themselves, the two
horsemen who have given youth to the old &#262;yavanas,
rode upon asses before they rode upon horses. The myth
of the gandharvâs and that of the Açvinâu, the myth of
the horse and that of the ass, are intimately connected:
from the gandharvâs the açvin comes forth; from the
mythical ass the horse comes out. This is unnatural in
zoology, but it is very natural in mythology: the sun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
comes, now out of the grey shades of night, and now out
of the grey cloud.</p>

<p>The Vedic hymns already present us with several interesting
myths concerning the ass.</p>

<p>The ass of the Açvinâu is swift; the devotees ask the
Açvinâu when they are to yoke it, that they may be
carried by it to the sacrifice.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> In another hymn, as the
Açvinâu are two, so are their asses two (râsabhâv açvino&#7717;).
Finally, the second strophe of the 116th hymn offers
us a twofold significant particularity, viz., the ass, that
vanquishes a thousand in the rich battlefield of Yamas
(or in the nocturnal battle, in the struggle in hell, in
which the ass appears as a real warrior, joined with
riches, and fighting for riches), and is helped by strong
and rapid wings (in which it shows us the ass that
flies).<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p>The <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> also represents the ass of Indras as
swift-footed.<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> But in the same hymn we already see
the reverse of the medal, that is to say, the swift ones
who deride him who is not swift, the horses that are
urged before the ass.<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> The solar hero, towards morning,
substitutes the horse for the ass, or appears with horses,
leaving the ass or asses behind. We have learned in the
preceding chapter how, in the heavenly race of the Vedic
gods, the asses gained the palm of victory; but it was
an effort superior to their powers. The <i>Âitareya Br.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>informs us that by this effort they lost their swiftness
and became draught animals, deprived of honey, but yet
preserving great vigour in their sperm, so that the male
ass can generate offspring in two ways, that is, mules by
union with a mare, and asses by union with an ass.<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>
Here, therefore, the ass is already considered an animal
of an essentially phallical nature, which notion is confirmed
by the precept of Kâtyâyanas, recorded by Professor
Weber,<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> which enjoins the sacrificing of an ass to
expiate violated chastity. To chastise the ass, to sacrifice
the ass, must mean the same as to chastise and to mortify
the body,<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> and especially the phallos; and the Eastern
and Western punishment of leading adulterers about upon
an ass has the same meaning; the real martyr, however,
in this punishment being the ass, who is exposed to every
kind of derision and ill-treatment. In the same way, the
henpecked husband who allowed himself to be beaten
by his wife, used, in several villages of Piedmont, only a
few years ago, to be led about ignominiously upon an
ass: a husband who lets his wife impose upon him, and
cannot subdue her, deserves to be chastised by means of
an ass; he is not a man, and his ass, the emblem of his
manly strength, must on this account suffer the punishment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>because he has not shown himself able to assert his
marital rights. The adulterer upon the ass, and the silly
husband upon the ass, are punishments for phallic offences
in, and in connection with, the person of that which
represents the phallos: one is chastised for having
wished, in this regard, to do too much, and the other for
not having been able to do enough. On this account the
condemned person was forced, in similar cases, to ride
upon an ass with his face turned towards the animal's
tail, another image which is yet more manifestly phallical;
whence the very name of the punishment, "asini caudam
in manu tenere."<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> As to the other proverb which says,
"He to whom the ass belongs, holds him by the tail,"
it is explained by the narrative of a peasant who drew
his ass out of a swamp, taking it by the tail; but this
story too seems to have a phallic signification.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
The ass, therefore, is already deposed from his noble
place as a swift-footed courser in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> itself.
And in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, too, where we have observed the
ass described as a warrior who fights for the gods, we
find him in the demoniacal form of a disagreeable singer
who terrifies the worshippers of the god Indras; the
latter is therefore requested by the poet to kill the ass
who sings with a horrible voice.<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> Here the ass already
appears as a real monster, worthy even of the steel of the
prince of the celestial heroes himself, who prepares to
combat him. The ass, therefore, is already sacred to the
monsters in the white Ya&#501;urvedas.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> the slowness of the ass has
already become proverbial. The modest Bharatas excuses
himself from not being able to equal his brother Râmas
in the science of government, just as the ass, he says,
cannot run like the horse, or other birds cannot fly like
the vulture. The mythical ass, moreover, appears in
this epic poem<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> in a demoniacal and infernal aspect:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>Bharatas, in fact, dreams of seeing his dead father
Daçarathas, in blood-coloured clothes, borne to the
southern funereal region on a car drawn by asses; and
we are told that when a man is seen upon a car drawn
by asses, it is a sign of his departure for the abode of
Yamas. Kharas, a word which, as we already know,
means ass, is also the name of a younger brother of the
great monster Râva&#7751;as. Râva&#7751;as himself is drawn by
asses upon a chariot adorned with gold and gems. These
asses have the faces of the monster Piçâ&#263;âs,<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> that is, faces
of parrots, as Hanumant afterwards informs us when he
speaks of the monsters which he has seen in Lañkâ,
which he also says are as swift as thought.<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> We know
that the coursers of Râva&#7751;as were asses, and therefore
the asses with the faces of the Piçâ&#263;âs, and the horses of
the monsters with the faces of parrots, are the same. The
monster Piçâ&#263;âs, therefore, has the face of a parrot. How
is it that the parrot is reared in India as a sacred bird?
It appears to me that equivocation in language had something
to do with the formation of this singular mythological
image. The word <i>piçâ&#263;as</i> is derived, like <i>piçañgas</i>, which
means golden and red, from the root <i>piç</i>, to adorn; whence
also the Vedic feminine <i>piç</i>, ornament, and the Vedic
neuter, <i>peças</i>, coloured tissue. The ass piçâ&#263;as, who draw
the chariot full of gold, are therefore themselves, at least in
their face, in their foremost part, golden asses, or red like
the colour of gold, red like the colour of the sun; in fact,
we find kharas (the ardent) as the proper name of an
attendant on the sun, and kharâ&#7751;çus or khararaçmi&#7717;,
he of the burning ray, as Sansk&#7771;it names of the sun.
Kharaketus, he who has a burning ray, is also the name
of one of the monsters in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>.<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> We therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>already see here the golden ass and the infernal
monster identified with the sun; and hence we are very
near the monster with the parrot's face. In the preceding
chapter we observed how the solar horse appears in
the morning luminous at first in its foremost parts,&mdash;now
in its legs, now in its face, now in its mane, which is
called golden; it is only the head of the horse which is
found in the butter; of Dadhya&#324;&#263; we perceive only his
head in connection with the ambrosia. Thus of the
nocturnal ass, of the demoniacal ass, of the demon himself,
the piçâ&#263;as (the piçâ&#263;âs are called carnivorous<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>), only
the face is seen, in the same way as of the piçâ&#263;âs, and
of the horses belonging to the monsters, only the head is
that of a parrot. But what connection can there be
between the gold colour of the ass piçâ&#263;as and the green
colour of the parrot? The equivoque lies probably in
the words <i>hari</i> and <i>harit</i>, both of which, in the Hindoo
tongue mean yellow, as well as green. Haris and hari
signify the sun, and the moon, as being yellow; harayas
and haritas are the horses of the sun; harî are the two
horses of Indras and of the Açvinâu, of whom we also know
that they more usually rode upon asses. We thus arrive
at the light-coloured asses, at the asses that are golden, at
least in their foremost parts, that is, in the morning twilight,
when after his nocturnal course, the solar horseman
is on the point of arriving at his golden eastern destination,
whence the head of the ass which carries the divine
horseman is illumined by him. But <i>haris</i>, besides signifying
the solar hero as being yellow, also signifies the
parrot as green; on this account the ass or demon with
a golden head was exchanged with the ass or monster
with the green head, or with the parrot's head. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
shall see in the chapters concerning birds how the bird
was often substituted for the horse in the office of carrying
the deity or the hero.</p>

<p>To conclude the subject of the Hindoo mythical ass, it
is certain that it existed in the heavens; it is certain
that it flies in the sky, that it fights in the sky like a
valiant warrior, that it terrifies its enemies in the sky
with its terrible voice; that, in a word, it was a real
and legitimate heroic animal. It is certain, moreover,
that, considered under another aspect, it not only throws
down the heroes, but carries them to hell, serves the
infernal monsters, and is found in connection with the
treasures of hell. Moreover, admitting, as I hope the
reader will, my identification of the mythical ass with
the gandharvas, we have the ass as dancer, the ass as
musician, the ass who loves women, and the ass in the
odorous ointment and in the inebriating drink, the somas
which occupies the place of the wine of the Dionysian
mysteries, in which the Hellenic ass took a solemn part.</p>

<p>In the fables of the <i>Pa&#324;&#263;atantram</i>, the ass is partly
modelled on the Hellenic type and partly preserves its
primitive character. The fourth book shows us the ass
twice attracted towards the lion by the jackal, who
induces him to believe that a beautiful female ass is
awaiting him. The ass is distrustful and shows his fear,
but the argument of the female ass, upon which the
artful jackal insists, overcomes his timidity. He is,
however, cunning enough to send the jackal before him;
and at the sight of the lion he perceives the jackal's
treachery and turns, fleeing away with such rapidity
that the lion cannot overtake him. The jackal returns
to the assault, and convinces the ass that he did wrong
to abandon the beautiful female ass when he was on the
point of receiving her favours; and thus touching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
tender chord of his heart, he goes on to assure him that
the female ass will throw herself into the fire or the
water if she does not see him return. "Omnia vincit
amor;" the ass returns, and this time the lion surprises
and tears him to pieces; upon which the lion, before
partaking of his meal, goes to perform his ablutions and
devotions. Meanwhile the jackal eats the ass's heart
and ears, and makes the lion, on his return, believe that
the stupid animal had neither the one nor the other,
because if he had had them, he would not have returned
to the dangerous spot after having once escaped. The
lion declares himself to be perfectly satisfied with this
explanation. Here we have a mixture in the ass of
swift-footedness, lust, and stupidity, his stupidity being
caused by his lustfulness. Now, it is possible that
his acquaintance with the Hellenic ass may have
induced the author of the <i>Pa&#324;&#263;atantram</i> to embody
in the ass a quality which is generally attributed in
fables of Hindoo origin to the monkey; but this is not
absolutely necessary in order to explain the narrative
of which we have now given the epitome.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in the fourth book of the <i>Pa&#324;&#263;atantram</i>,
the fable of the ass in the tiger's skin&mdash;an
insignificant variety of the ass in the lion's skin&mdash;was,
as Professor Weber has already proved, taken from the
Æsopian fable. Another fable, in the fifth book, which
tells us of the ass who, being passionately fond of music,<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>
insisted upon singing, and was thus discovered and made
a slave of, also seems to be of Hellenic origin. But,
although the editing of these two Hindoo fables in a
literary form had its origin in the knowledge of Hellenic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
literature, the original myth of the ass-lion (haris, which
is the horse of Indras, also means the lion), and that of
the ass-musician (as gandharvas and gardabhas), can be
traced as far back as the Vedic scriptures.</p>

<p>In the Zendic <i>Yaçna</i>,<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> I find a new proof, which
appears to me a very satisfactory one, of the identification
which I have proposed of the ass with the gandharvas.
I have already mentioned the gandharvas who
guards over the somas in the midst of the waters, and
I observed how the gandharvas k&#7771;içânus of the Vedâs,
and the Zend kereçâni who guards over the <i>hom</i> in the
<i>Vôuru-Kasha</i>, have been identified. But the same
office is fulfilled in the <i>Yaçna</i> by a three-legged ass,
that is, a lame ass (or the solar horse who has become
lame during the night, in the same way as the solar
hero becomes lame, or a lame devil), who, by braying,
terrifies the monsters and prevents them from contaminating
the water.</p>

<p>In the first of the seven adventures of Rustem, in the
<i>Shah-Name</i> of Firdusi, the starving Rustem goes with
his brave heroic horse to chase wild asses. The asses
flee, but the hero's horse is swifter than they, and overtakes
them; Rustem takes one by means of a lasso, and
has it cooked, throwing away the bones. He then goes
to sleep (<i>then</i> sometimes expresses in the myths the
interval of a whole day or of a whole year.&mdash;The hero
does almost the same in his second adventure and in the
book of <i>Sohrab</i>). While Rustem sleeps, a monstrous
lion makes its appearance to surprise the hero; Rustem's
heroic horse throws the lion down and tears it to pieces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
with its hoofs and teeth. This battle between the horse
of the sleeping hero and the monster lion is an epic
form of the fable which represents the animals as being
terrified in the forest by the braying of the ass, and of
that of the lion itself killed by the ass's kick. Probably
the bones of the dead ass, when preserved, gave heroic
strength to Rustem's horse.</p>

<p>In the Mongol stories, of which we have on a previous
occasion indicated the Hindoo origin, we find two other
legends relating to the ass. In the eighteenth Mongol
story, a foolish man goes with his ass to hang up some
rice; he hides his ass in a cave; some merchants pass
by with their goods, and the fool sends forth, by means
of a trumpet, such a sonorous shout, that the merchants,
thinking brigands are hidden in the cavern, escape,
leaving their goods in the ass's possession. Here the
fool and the ass are already identified. The trumpet
and the blowing made by the fool correspond to the
braying of the ass, of whom we shall soon see other
miracles related. The sense of the myth is this: the
solar hero in the night or in the cloud grows stupid;
he becomes an ass during the night or in the cloud; the
cloud thunders, and the thunder of the cloud gives rise
to the idea now of the braying and now of the flatus of
the ass (or the fool), now of a trumpet,<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> and now of a
drum. We must not forget that the word <i>dundubhis</i>
which properly means kettledrum or drum, is also the
name of a monster, and that Dundubhî is the proper
name of the wife of a gandharvas, or of a gandharvî.
The skin of the drum being made of an ass's hide is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
more reason why the thundering cloud, being very
naturally likened to a drum, the thunder should be also
considered now as a <i>flatus oris</i>, now as a <i>flatus ventris</i> of
the celestial ass, or of the foolish hero who accompanies
him.</p>

<p>In the twenty-second Mongol story we have a variety,
though partly a less complete and partly a richer one, of
the fable of the Phrygian king Midas. A king who has
golden ass ears, has his head combed every night with
golden combs by young men, who are immediately after
put to death (to comb the ass's head is about the same as
to wash it; but however much it is combed, the ears can
never be abolished). One day a young man predestined
to the highest honours, before going to comb the king's
head, receives from his mother a cake made of her own
milk and flour. The young man offers the cake to the
king, who likes it, and spares the youth's life on condition
that he tells no one, not even his mother, the
great secret, <i>viz.</i>, that the king has golden ears. The
youth promises to preserve silence, and makes a very
great effort indeed to keep his promise, but this effort
makes him seriously ill, so much so that he feels he will
burst if he does not tell the secret. His mother then
advises him to go and relieve his mind by whispering it
into a fissure of the earth or of a tree. The young man
does so; he goes into the open country, finds a squirrel's
hole, and breathes gently down it, "Our king has ass's
ears;" but animals have understanding and can speak,
and there are men who understand their language. The
secret is conveyed from one to another, till the king
hears that the young man has divulged it. He threatens
to take his life; but relents when he hears from him
how it happened, and not only pardons him, but makes
him his prime minister. The fortunate youth's first act<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
is to invent a cap of the shape of the ears of an ass, in
order that the king may be able to conceal the deformity;
and when the people see the king with a cap of this
shape, it pleases them so much that they all adopt it;
and so the king, by means of his young minister, is no
longer obliged to live secluded, and in the constant tormenting
dread of discovery, but lives at his ease and
happily ever afterwards.</p>

<p>Having thus examined under its principal aspects the
most popular Asiatic tradition relative to the ass, let us
now go on to epitomise the European tradition, and, if
possible, more briefly; all the more that the reader,
having, as I hope, now the key of the myth, will be of
himself able to refer to it many analogous particulars of
Græco-Latin tradition. I say Græco-Latin alone, because
the myth of the ass among Slavonic and Germanic
nations, where the ass is little, if at all, known, had
no especial and independent development. In Slavonic
countries, the part of the ass is generally sustained by
Ivan the fool or Emilius the lazy one, as also by the
bear or wolf, as in India it is often sustained by the
monkey;<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> ass, bear, wolf, and monkey, as mythical
animals, represent almost identical phenomena.</p>

<p>Let us take the story of Midas again at its commencement.</p>

<p>Midas appears in <i>Herodotus</i>, not only as a king of
Phrygia, but as a progenitor of the Phrygians. In the
Tusculans of Cicero, the drunken satyr Silenos (originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
another form of the same Midas, the satyrs having ass's
ears), the master of Dionysos, loses himself in the rose-garden
belonging to Midas, before whom he is conducted,
and by whom he is benevolently received and entertained,
and then sent back with honour to the god, who,
in gratitude, concedes to Midas the gift of turning to
gold everything that he touches, to such an extent as to
affect the food that he wishes to eat and the water in
which he bathes. This myth is probably of a complex
nature. Midas ought, like the ass, to turn to gold what
he has eaten, that is, to turn his food and drink into
excrements of gold, to fructify the golden ears of corn,
<i>i.e.</i>, in heaven, the solar rays. Cicero himself leads us
to suppose that the myth of Midas is in relation with
the ears of corn, when, in his first book <i>De Divinatione</i>,
he says that the ants carried grains of wheat into the
mouth of Midas when a child; these being symbols of
abundance and of fecundity which are quite applicable to
the mythical ass. For although the common ass is not
a privileged f&#339;cundator, the mythical ass, in its capacity
of a rain-giving cloud or &#263;iramehin, is the best fertiliser
of the fields. The sun, or gold, or treasure, comes out of
the ass-darkness or ass-cloud. The ass Lucius, after
having eaten the roses of morning or the east, again
becomes Lucius the luminous one (the sun). On this
account the ass Midas, too, who also delights in roses,
turns to gold whatever he eats, as well as the dew or
ambrosial fountain in which he bathes; the rosy becomes
the golden; the sun comes out of the contact of the ass
of night with the aurora.</p>

<p>Servius, in his commentary on the sixth book of the
<i>Æneid</i>, also tells us the centauri "in floribus stabulant,"
as the Hindoo gandharvas in the perfumes. These perfumes
are rain and dew. The ass crowned with loaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
of bread<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> and flowers, in the Latin worship of Vesta,
who remembered the service rendered to her one day by
the braying of the ass, which aroused her from her sleep
when some one was attempting to violate her, is another
variety of the myth of the aurora who awakes out of the
night, golden, that is, rich in golden oats and in golden
wheat. The ass itself is sacrificed, because, perhaps, it
was the ass itself that had made an attempt to deprive
Vesta of her chastity; but having betrayed itself, as it
often happens in fables, by its braying, it arouses Vesta,
who punishes it by offering it in sacrifice. In a variation
of the same story in the first book of Ovid's <i>Fasti</i>,
where instead of Vesta we have the nymph Lothis
asleep, the red Priapos, who wishes to violate her, also
loses his opportunity, because the ass of Silenos&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>on which account it is killed by Priapos:</p>

</div></div>

<p>The apologue is well known of the long-eared ass,
who, when called upon to judge between the nightingale
and the cuckoo as to who has the sweetest voice, decides
in favour of the cuckoo. The nightingale then appeals
to man with the sweet song that we are all acquainted
with.<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> In the myth of Midas, the Phrygian hero is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>given ass's ears as a chastisement by Apollo, because,
having been called upon to judge between the cithern or
lyre of Apollo (whence the proverb "Asinus ad lyram")
and the pastoral pipe (calamus agrestis) of Pan (who
is represented as a horned and bearded satyr, with a tail
and long ears), he pronounced that the pan-pipes were
the most harmonious instrument. Midas hides his ears
in a red cap, but his comber lets out the secret, as in
the Mongol story, and in a manner almost identical&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The same Greeks who held the ass up to derision,
made the Phrygian king Midas, of the ass's ears, the
object of their satire. This is a particular form of the
mythico-heroic struggle between Greeks and Phrygians
or Trojans. Apollo is the enemy of the Trojans, as he is
the enemy of the Phrygian king Midas. The Trojans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
and Troy are represented by the ass, and the Greeks, who
vanquish and take by assault the Trojan fortress, by the
horse; the sun disperses the night; the hero kills the
centaur; the horse defeats the ass, the Greek the Trojan;
and every one can see how the fact that the Greeks
personified in the ass their enemies in Asia Minor, must
have damaged the reputation of the poor long-eared
animal. The most bitter and cutting satire is always
that which is directed towards one's own enemies; and
the ass, unfortunately, had at one time the honour of
representing the Phrygian, the traditional enemy of the
Greek. The ass bore the load of this heroic war, in the
same way as in the Middle Ages he was publicly impaled
by the Paduans for having had the misfortune of being
the sacred animal on the arms of the city of Vicenza,
with which the Paduans lived in rivalry.<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p>In the same eleventh book of Ovid where the transformation
of the human ears of Midas into ass's ears is
described, it is very remarkable that the new ears are
called whitish, as in the Mongol story they are said to
be golden. This confirms still more the interpretation of
the myth, to the effect that the ass is the solar steed
during the night. The head and the tail of the night,
conceived as an animal, are now the two whitish or grey
twilights, and now the two golden auroras of morning
and evening.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The changeableness of the twilights must have served
very well to express the mobility of the ears of an ass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
In the story of the ass, Midas, the musical critic, the
predestined ass, pronounces in favour of Pan; and he
does so not only on account of the consanguinity between
himself and the god, but also from a patriotic feeling.
Pan was born in a forest of Arcadia, of Zeus and the
nymph Kallisto; and it is well known that antiquity
celebrated the asses of Arcadia above those of every
other country. The ass as a musician, the ass as a
musical critic, Pan the musician, and Pan preferred by
the ass, are the same person. Arcadia, the country of
pastoral music, of whistling shepherds, which made the
Italy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries bleat
out so many useless verses, the country of Pan the satyr,
<i>par excellence</i>, is the country of the ass. Arcadia is the
most mountainous and wooded part of Greece,<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> and
therefore, when the Olympians came down from heaven,
celestial nymphs and satyrs came to people the forests
and fountains of Arcadia. The divine guardian of the
ambrosia in the heavenly cloud takes, in the Arcadian
forest, the form of Pan, god of shepherds, who keeps guard
over the honey. The gandharvâs, who danced and sung
in the Hindoo Olympus with the apsarasas, has descended
into Arcadia in the shape of Pan, to dance and sing with
the nymphs.<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a> Pan who goes alone into the gloomy
forest, Pan who chases fear away, connected as he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>with the story of the ass, reminds us on the one hand of
the superstition recorded by Pliny, to the effect that an
ass's skin put upon children chases fear from them<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>
(in the same way as in the province of Girgenti, in
Sicily, it is believed that shoes made of a wolf's skin, put
on children's feet, make them daring and lucky in battle),
and, on the other hand, of the unpublished Piedmontese
story of the fearless Giovannino, who, in reward for
his courage in going alone to hell, brings away with
him an ass which throws gold from its tail.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>Tzetzas<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> I find again the curious notion that Midas sold
his own <i>stercus</i> out of avarice, that is, that he changed
it into gold, as Vespasian used to do by selling the
excrement of his horse.</p>

<p>The Æsopian ass, when he goes to battle, terrifies by
his braying all the animals of the forest; so Pan defeats
his enemies by means of his terrible voice; and according
to Herodotus,<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> in the heroic battle of Marathon,
the Athenians were helped by the powerful voice of the
god Pan. Finally, as we have seen Apollo to be the
rival of Pan and the enemy of the Phrygian Midas, the
predestined ass, as well as of the Trojans, so, in the
eleventh of the Pythic odes of Pindar, we find the hero
Perseus, among the Hyperboreans,<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> eating asses.<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> The
morning sun devours the ass of night, as we have seen
the solar hero Rustem do in the <i>Shah-Name</i>, where he
eats the wild asses.</p>

<p>But we must look for more mythical personages in
connection with the ass Midas in Arcadia, as the region
of Pan and of asses. The ass Midas is considered as a
rich progenitor of races, and is supposed to have been
the first Phrygian. Windischmann has already observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>(with the examples of Yamas, Yima, Manus, Minos, and
Radamanthüs) the connection between the rich progenitor
of races and the rich king or judge of hell. To
Midas the progenitor and to Midas the judge, corresponds
the ass whose excrements are of gold, the ass
judge and prophet, the Arcadian and prophetic Pan.
The Arcadians considered themselves not only autocthonoi,
but proselênoi, or anterior to the moon. But
they are also considered in the light of inhabitants of
an infernal region. In Arcadia was situated the lake
Stümphalos, the demoniacal birds of which were slain by
Hêraklês in Arcadia; in a chasm formed of wild rocks
was the source of the Styx, the principal infernal river,
that by which the Hellenic infernal beings were accustomed
to swear. Greek and Latin writers used to narrate of
the ass (and the mule) that it had an especial aversion to
the water of the Styx, as being poisonous. This superstition,
when referred to the myth, appears to mean that,
when the solar hero drinks this water&mdash;the water of the
dark or cloudy ocean&mdash;he becomes a dark ass. (We find
in Russian stories the hero who is transformed into a bull,
a horse, or a he-goat, when he drinks water of which a
demoniacal bull, horse, or he-goat has previously drunk.)
Ælianos, in his tenth book relative to animals, speaking
of the horned asses of Scythia, writes that they held in
their horns the water of the Styx. A similar narrative
is given by Philostratos in the third book of his romantic
Life of Apollonios, concerning the fabulous horned ass of
India. "It is said," he writes, "that in the marshy
ground near the Indian river Hyphasis many wild asses
are to be found; and that these wild beasts have on
their heads a horn with which they fight bravely like
bulls" (this seems to be a reminiscence of the Indian
rhinoceros); "and that the Indians form out of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
horns drinking-cups, affirming that those who drink out
of these cups are delivered from every illness for all that
day; when wounded they feel no pain, they pass safely
through flames, nor, when they have drunk out of it,
can they be hurt by any poison. They say that these
cups belong to kings alone, nor is it permitted to any
other than a king to hunt the animal. It is narrated
that Apollonios (the hero of the romance) had seen this
animal and observed its nature with wonder. Moreover,
to Damis, who asked him whether he had faith in what
was commonly said concerning the virtue of this cup, he
answered 'I will believe it when I shall have learned
that in this country the king is immortal.'" And no
doubt Apollonios would have believed had it been impossible
for him to divine that the king who makes use
of this marvellous cup is the immortal sun, to whom
alone it is reserved to kill the ass of the nocturnal forest,
the ass whose hairy ears are like horns,<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> whose ears are
of gold.</p>

<p>The horn of the Scythian ass full of Stygian water,
the horn of the ass which, when used as a cup, gives
health and happiness to him who drinks out of it, remind
us (not to speak of Samson's jaw-bone of an ass,
which makes water flow) especially of the myth of the
cornucopia and that of the goat, with which the satyrs
and fauns, having goat's feet, stand in particular connection.
It is also for this reason that the ass is found in
relation with Pan; wherefore it is too that Silenos rides
upon an ass, and appears, as we have already seen, in
the story of Midas, in his garden of roses; indeed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
mythical centaurs or onocentaurs, satyr, faun, ass, and
goat are equivalent expressions. We have seen, a few
pages back, the Zendic three-legged ass; in the following
chapter we shall find the lame goat.</p>

<p>As the ass was ridden by Silenos,<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> so was he the
animal dedicated to Bacchus and to Priapos, whose
mysteries were celebrated in the Dionysian feasts. It is
said that when Bacchus had to traverse a marsh, he met
with two young asses, and was conveyed by one of them,
who was endowed with human speech, to the other side
without touching the water. (The 116th hymn of the
first book of the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> merits being especially compared
with this. In it, immediately after having represented
the Açvinâu as drawn by winged asses, the poet
celebrates the Açvinâu as delivering the hero Bhugyus
out of the waters upon a vessel that moved of itself in
the air.)<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> On this account it is said that Bacchus, in
gratitude, placed the two young asses among the stars.<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
This is another confirmation of the fact that the mythical
ass really had the virtue of flying; and the proverb
"Asinus si volat habet alas"<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> alludes to this myth. The
fable of the ass who wishes to fly, and the flight of the
ass, are derisive allusions, applied to the earthly ass.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>The celestial myth lingers in the memory, but is no longer
understood.</p>

<p>In the myth of Prometheus, in <i>Ælianos</i> (vi. 5), we
have the ass who carries the talisman which makes
young again, which Zeus intended for him who should
discover the robber of the divine fire (Prometheus). The
ass, being thirsty, approaches a fountain, and is about to
drink, when a snake who guards the fountain prevents
him from doing so. The ass offers the snake the charm
which he is carrying, upon which the serpent strips off
its old age, and the ass, drinking at the fountain, acquires
the power of becoming young again. The ass of night,
when he drinks the dew of the dawn, grows young and
handsome again every day. It is on this account, I repeat,
that youth is celebrated as a peculiar virtue of the ass;
it is on this account that the Romans attributed a great
cosmetic virtue to ass's milk<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> (the white dawn, or moon).</p>

<p>The mythical ass seems to die every day, whereas, on
the contrary it is born anew every day, and becomes
young again; whence the Greek proverb does not celebrate
the death in the singular, but the deaths of the
ass ("Onou thanatous").</p>

<p>The Italian proverb of the ass that carries wine and
drinks water, probably alludes to the ass that carries the
water of youth, and then, being thirsty, drinks at the
fountain in the legend of Prometheus. The wine of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
Hellenic and Latin myth corresponds to the inebriating
drink or somas in which Indras delights so much in the
<i>&#7770;igvedas</i>. The ass bears the drunken Silenos on its back.</p>

<p>The sun, who in the cloud is covered with the skin of
an ass, carries the rain; whence the Greek proverb the
ass is wetted by the rain ("Onos hüetai"), and the
popular belief that when the ears of the ass or of a satyr
(that is to say, of the ass itself) move, it is an indication
of rainy weather (or dew). When the sun comes out of the
shadows of night, he drinks the milk or white humour
of the early morning sky, the same white foaming
humour which caused the birth of Aphroditê, the same
humour out of which, by the loves of Dionysos (or of
Pan, of a satyr, or of the ass itself) and Aphroditê, the
satyr was procreated&mdash;Priapos, whose phallic loves are
discovered by the ass. The satyr serves as a link between
the myth of the ass and that of the goat. On this
account (that is, on account of the close relation between
the mythical ass and the mythical goat) two ancient
Greek and Latin proverbs&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to dispute about the
shadow of the ass ("Peri onou skias") and to dispute,
"De lana caprina"&mdash;have the same meaning, a dispute
concerning a bagatelle (but which is no trifle in the
myth, where the skin of the goat or of the ass is sometimes
changed into a golden fleece), which seems so
much the more probable, as the Greeks have also handed
down to us another proverb in which the man who
expects to reap where he has not sown is laughed at as
one who looks for the wool of the ass ("Onou pokas
zêteis"), or who shears the ass ("Ton onon keireis").
We have seen, in the myth of Midas, the king, whose ears,
when combed, betray his asinine nature. The Piedmontese
story of the maiden on whose forehead a horn or an
ass's tail grows, because she has badly combed the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
fairy's head, is connected with this story of the combing
of the long-eared Midas. The combed ass and the
sheared ass correspond with one another; the combed
ass has golden ears, in the same way as gold and gems
fall from the head of the good fairy combed by the good
girl in the fairy tale. To this mythical belief, I think,
may be traced the origin of the mediæval custom in the
Roman Church, which lasted till the time of Gregory
VII., in which public ovations were offered to the Pope,
and an ass bearing money upon its head was brought
before him.<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a></p>

<p>The shadow of the ass<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> betrays him, no less than his
ears, his nose, and his braying. The shadow of the ass
and his nose are found in connection with each other
in the legend of the Golden Ass of Apuleius, which, after
narrating how the ass, by putting his head out of the
window, had betrayed his master the greengrocer or
gardener (the friend of perfumes, "Gandharvas, asinus,
in unguento, onos en müro"), concludes thus: "The
miserable gardener having been found again, and taken
before the magistrates to pay the fine, they lead him to
a public prison, and with great laughter cease not, says the
ass Lucius, to "make merry with my face;" whence also
was derived the popular proverb concerning the face and
shadow of the ass ('De prospectu et umbra asini')." The
ass who betrays his master the greengrocer or gardener
by his face is a variety of the ass who, dressed in the forest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>in the lion's skin<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> (like Hêraklês who goes into hell dressed
in a lion's skin), betrays himself by his braying, and of
the ass who discovers by his braying Priapos, who
delights in gardens (the vulva), Priapos the gardener,
like the ogre<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> of the <i>Pentamerone</i>, who finds before him
in his garden a beautiful maiden.</p>

<p>The ass can restrain neither his voice nor his flatus;
we have already seen something similar in the story of
Midas, where the comber of the ass feels he will burst if
he is not permitted to relieve himself of the secret of the
ass. Diogenês of Laertes narrates that the fields of
Agrigentum being devastated by malignant winds which
destroyed the crops, the philosopher Empedocles instructed
them to take asses' skins, and having made
sacks of them, carry them to the summits of the hills
and mountains, to chase the winds away. Ælianos, confounding
one noise with another, suggests, to prevent
the ass from braying, the advantage of appending a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>stone to its tail. This ancient Greek fable is to this
day very popular in Italy, and the narrator is accustomed
to furbish it up with a character of actuality, as if it
had happened yesterday, and among his acquaintances.</p>

<p>In the Italian stories,<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> when the ass brays upon the
mountain, a tail grows on the forehead of the step-mother's
ugly daughter; the third crowing of the cock
is the signal for the monster's death; the third braying
or flatus of the ass announces the death of the fool.
With the end of the night the ass disappears, and the
fool also disappears or dies. The braying of the ass
cannot mount up into heaven; after the ass has brayed,
after the cloud has thundered, the ass comes down
upon the earth, is dissolved into rain, is dispersed
and dies; the dark ass cannot remain in the luminous
sky, it can only inhabit the cloudy, watery, or gloomy
sky of hell. The way in which the fool of the story tries
to elude death resembles that which was used, according
to Ælianos, to prevent the ass from braying. In a story
of Armagnac,<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> Joan lou Péc runs after a man whom he
believes to be a sage, and asks him when he will die;
the man answers, "Joan lou Péc, mouriras au troisièmo
pet de toun ase." The ass does so twice; the fool
endeavours to prevent the third: "Cop sec s'en-angonc
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>cerca un pau (a stake) bien pounchut et l'enfouncéc das
un martet dens lou cu de l'ase. Mes l'ase s'enflec tant, e
hasconc tant gran effort, que lou pau sourtisconc coumo
no balo e tuèc lou praube Joan lou Péc."</p>

<p>In <i>Herodotus</i>, the Scythians are defeated when the
asses bray, and the dogs bark among Darius's tents. The
braying of the ass, the thunder of the cloud, is an oracle;
the ass that brays is a judge and a prophet. In hell
everything is known; the devil knows every art, every
species of malice, every secret; the ass in hell participates
in this knowledge. The ass Nicon, in <i>Plutarch</i>,
in the Life of Antony, predicts to Augustus his victory
at the battle of Actium; on the contrary, in the Life of
Alexander, by the same author, an ass who kills with a
kick a great lion belonging to the Macedonian, appears
to the great conqueror in the light of an evil omen. The
dying sun of evening, the old lion, is killed in the evening
by the ass of night; in the morning, on the contrary,
the ass of night announces his fortune to the solar hero,
who again becomes luminous and wise. The ass can
predict all things, because it knows all things; it knows
everything, because it hears everything, and it hears
everything by means of its exceedingly long ears; the
ass of Apuleius says of itself: "Recreabar quod auribus
præditus cuncta longule etiam dissita sentiebam." And
this ass which listens from a distance reminds us again
of the third brother, now a fool, and now only supposed
to be a fool; to the Andalusian Oidin-Oidon, hijo del
buen oidor (a relation of the already cited Vedic Indras
âçrutkar&#7751;as), of the second cuento of Caballero,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> who
hears everything that is done in the deepest parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
hell, where Lucifer sits, horned and large-eared. The
hero who combats with Lucifer only thinks of cutting
off his ear; the ass without ears is no longer an ass; the
ears of the mythical ass are its vital and characteristic
organs. Instead of ears, give horns to the mythical ass,
and we have the mythical goat; take the horns away
and we have now the mythical abject sheep, now the
hog; this is what we shall see in the two next chapters.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p>When the girl aurora leads out of the stable in the
morning her radiant flock, among them there are found
to be white lambs, white kids, and luminous sheep; in
the evening the same aurora leads the lambs, the kids,
and the sheep back to the fold. In the early dawn
all this flock is white, by and by their fleeces are
golden fleeces; the white, and afterwards the golden
heavens of the east (or the west) constituting this white
and golden flock, and the sun's rays their fleeces. Then
the sun himself, who steps forth from this flock, is now
its young shepherd-king, and now the lamb, the ram,
or he-goat. When the sun enters into the region of
night, the he-goat or lamb goes back to the fold and
becomes dark-coloured; the sun veiled by the night or
the cloud is a dark-coloured ram, he-goat, or she-goat.
In the night, says the proverb, all cows are black; and
the same might be said of goats, except in the case
of the goat, luminous and all-seeing, coming out of the
nocturnal darkness in the form of the moon. We must,
therefore, consider the sheep or goat under a triple
aspect; the principal and most interesting aspect being
that of the sun veiled by the gloom, or by the cloud,
which wears often a demoniacal form, such as that of the
ass or of the hero in hell; the second being that of the
grey-white, and afterwards golden sky of morning, or
of the golden and thereafter grey-white sky of evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
which, as a luminous, is therefore generally a divine form
of the goat; and the third aspect being that of the moon.</p>

<p>The richest myths refer to the sun enclosed in the
cloud or the shades of night, or to the cloud or darkness
of night closing round the sun. The shifting shadow
and the moving cloud on the one side, the damp night
and the rainy cloud on the other, easily came to be
represented as a goat and as a ram. In the Indian
tongue, or even the Vedic, <i>a&#501;as</i> is a word which means,
properly speaking, pushing, drawing, moving (agens),
and afterwards he-goat; the he-goat butts with its
horns; the sun in the cloud butts with its rays until it
opens the stable and its horns come out.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> The ram is
called <i>meshas</i>, or <i>mehas</i>, that is, the pourer or spreader,
mingens (like the ass &#263;iramehin), which corresponds with
the <i>meghas</i>, or cloud mingens. Moreover, as in Greek
from <i>aix</i>,<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> a goat, we have <i>aigis</i>, a skin (Ægis), so in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>Sansk&#7771;it from <i>a&#501;as</i>, a goat, we have <i>a&#501;inas</i>, a skin; and
from <i>meshas</i>, a ram, <i>meshas</i>, a fleece, a skin, and that
which is formed from it; whence the Petropolitan
Dictionary compares with it the Russian <i>mieh</i> (Lithuanian,
<i>maiszas</i>) skin and sack.</p>

<p>Let us now first of all see how these simple images
developed themselves in the Hindoo myth.</p>

<p>Indras, the pluvial and thundering god, is represented
in the first strophe of a Vedic hymn as a very celebrated
heroic ram;<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> in the second strophe, as the one who pours
out ambrosial honey (mada&#263;yutam); in the third strophe,
as opening the stable or precinct of the cows to the
Añgirasas;<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> in the fourth strophe, as killing the serpent
that covers or keeps back; in the fifth strophe, as expelling
the enchanters with enchantments, and breaking the
strong cities of the monster Piprus;<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> and in the sixth
strophe, as crushing under his foot the giant-like monster
Arbudas<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> or monster serpent. Thus far we have two
aspects of the myth, the ram which pours out ambrosial
honey, and the ram which opens the gate and crushes
with its foot. In another hymn the Açvinâu are compared
to two he-goats (a&#501;eva), to two horns (ç&#7771;iñgeva),
and to two swift dogs.<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> A third hymn informs us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>that Indras by means of a ram killed a leonine
monster.<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<p>Here we evidently have a heroic he-goat or ram.</p>

<p>Let us compare it with other traditions. In the
<i>Khorda Avesta</i><a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> we find Veretraghna (the Zend form of
Indras, as V&#7771;itrahan) "with the body of a warrior he-goat,
handsome, and with sharpened horns."</p>

<p>In the Russian tale given by <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> the lamb,
companion of the bull in the wood, kills the wolf by
butting against its sides, while the bull also wounds the
ferocious beast with its horns. In another variation of
the same story,<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> the cat is confederate with the lamb
against the wolf; the lamb butts hard at the wolf, while
the cat scratches it till blood flows. In yet another
version, besides the lamb, the he-goat also appears; the
cat twists some of the bark of the birch-tree round the
horns of the he-goat, and bids the lamb rub against it
to produce fire; sparks come from it, the cat fetches hay,
and the three companions warm themselves. The wolves
come up, and the cat makes them run, presenting them
the goat as a scarecrow, and frightening them further by
ominous hints as to the strength contained in its beard.
Finally, we have in the Russian stories two singular variations
of the fable of the goat, the kids, and the wolf.<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>The goat is about to give birth to her young ones under an
apple-tree. (We have seen in Chapter I. the apple-tree, the
fruit of which, when eaten, causes horns to sprout. It is
well-known that in Greek, <i>mêlon</i> means a goat and an
apple-tree, as the Hindoo masculine noun <i>petvas</i>, which
means a ram, is in the neuter <i>petvam</i> = ambrosia. The
mythical apple-tree is ambrosial, like the cornucopia of
the goat of mythology; and it seems to me that here, too,
I can find an analogy in the Slavonic field itself between
the Russian words <i>óblaka</i>, clouds, in the plural <i>ablaká</i>, the
clouds, and <i>iablony</i>, apple-tree, plural <i>jáblogna</i>, the apple-trees,
<i>jablok</i>, the apple.) The apple-tree advises the goat
to betake itself to some other place, as the apples might
fall upon its new-born kids and kill them. The goat
then goes to give birth to her young ones under an
equally shady walnut-tree; the walnut-tree also advises
her to go away, as the nuts might fall and do serious
harm to her little ones;<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> upon which the goat goes to a
deserted tent in the forest, another form of the cloud of
night. When the kids are brought forth, the goat issues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
forth out of the tent to procure food, and cautions her
children not to open to any one (the fable is well known
in the West, but the Slavonic variations are particularly
interesting). The wolf comes and pronounces the same
password as the goat to induce the kids to open, but
they perceive by the rough voice of the wolf that it is
not their mother, and refuse to admit him. The wolf
then goes to the blacksmith, and has a voice made for
him resembling that of the goat; the deceived kids open,
and the wolf devours them all except the smallest, who
hides under the stove (the favourite place where the little
Slavonic hero, the third brother, the ill-favoured fool,
who afterwards becomes handsome and wise, is accustomed
to squat). The goat returns, and learns from the
kid which has escaped the massacre of its brothers. She
thinks how to avenge herself, and invites her friend and
gossip the fox with the wolf to dinner; the unsuspecting
wolf arrives along with the fox. After dinner, the goat,
to divert her guests, invites them to amuse themselves
by leaping over an opening made in the floor; the goat
leaps first, then the fox leaps, and then the wolf, but
falls down on the burning ashes and is burnt to death,
like the witch in some other stories, as the night is
burned by the morning aurora; and the goat chaunts a
marvellous <i>Te Deum</i> (&#263;udesnoi pamin) in the wolf's
honour. The other Russian version adds some new and
curious details. The goat goes to find food, and leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
the kids alone; they shut the door after her. She
returns and says, "Open, my sons, my little fathers;
your mother is come; she has brought some milk, half
a side full of milk, half a horn full of fresh cheese, half
a little horn full of clear water (the cornucopia)."<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> The
kids open immediately. The second day the goat goes
out again; the wolf, who had heard the song, tries to
sing it to the kids; but the latter perceive that it is not
their mother's voice, and do not open. Next day the
wolf again imitates the mother's voice; the kids open
the door, and are all devoured except one which hides
itself in the stove, and afterwards narrates to the mother-goat
all that has happened. The goat avenges herself
as follows: She goes into the forest with the wolf, and
comes to a ditch where some workmen had cooked some
gruel, and left the fire still burning. The goat challenges
the wolf to leap the ditch; the wolf tries and falls into
it, where the fire makes his belly split open, from which
the kids, still alive, skip out and run to their mother.</p>

<p>Another story, however,<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> affords us still more aid in
the interpretation of the myth; that is, in leading us to
see in the goat and her kids the sun horned or furnished
with rays, as it issues radiant out of the cloud, or darkness,
or ocean of night, and in the wolf, or in the wolf's
skin, split open or burned, out of which the kids come,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>the dark, cloudy, watery nocturnal sky. Instead of the
wolf we have a witch, instead of the goat a woman, and
instead of the kids the young Vaniushka (Little John);
the witch has a voice made by the blacksmith like that
of Vaniushka's or Tereshi&#263;ko's mother, and thus attracts
him to her. Tereshi&#263;ha says that he was originally the
stump of a tree, which his father and mother, being
childless, had picked up in the forest, and wrapped up
and rocked in a cradle till he was born.</p>

<p>The monster wolf, or the witch, having the faculty of
simulating the voice of the goat,<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> and an especial predilection
for both sheep and goats,&mdash;so much so that the
witch Liho (properly Evil) keeps some in her house, and
those which come out (of the dark sky) in the morning,
and which re-enter (the dark sky) in the evening,
are considered her peculiar property,<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>&mdash;often transforms
the hero (the evening sun) into a kid (into the darkness or
cloud of night). Of course, as the dark and cloudy
monster is often represented as a wolf, it is easy to
understand his wish that everything should be transformed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>into a lamb in order to eat it. But the mythical
lamb or kid, the young solar hero, generally escapes out
of the jaws of the wolf, out of the hands of the witch, or
out of the darkness, the waters, or the cloud of night.</p>

<p>A Vedic hymn celebrates the strong Pûshan, who has
a he-goat for his horse (or who is a goat-horse), and is
called the lover of his sister. Perhaps these words contain
the germ of the Russian story of Little John, brother
of Little Helen, who is changed by witchcraft into a kid.
I have already observed in Chapter I. how Helen, who
at the commencement of the story shows affection for
her brother John, ends by betraying him. The Vedic
hymn would appear to contain the notion of the brother
Pûshan transformed into a he-goat (the sun which enters
into the cloud or darkness of night), because he has loved
his sister. In another Vedic hymn we have the sister
Yamî, who seduces her brother Yamas. In European
fairy tales, the sister loves her brother, who is metamorphosed
by the art of a witch, now into a young hog,
and now into a kid. In the forty-fifth story of the
fourth book of <i>Afanassieff</i>, Ivanushka (Little John)
becomes a kid after drinking out of a goat's hoof. In
the twenty-ninth story of the second book of <i>Afanassieff</i>,
Ivanushka and Little Helen, the children of a Tzar,
wander alone about the world. Ivanushka wishes to
drink where cows, horses, sheep, and hogs feed and
drink; his sister Little Helen advises him not to do so,
lest he should turn into a calf, a colt, a lamb, or a young
pig; but at last John is overcome by thirst, and, against
the advice of his sister, he drinks where goats drink, and
becomes a kid. A young Tzar marries the sister, and
gives every honour to the kid, but a witch throws the
young queen into the sea (Phrixos and Helle; in other
European stories, into a cistern), and usurps her place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
inducing the people to believe that she is Helen, and
commanding the kid to be put to death. The kid runs
to the shore and invokes his sister, who answers from
the bottom of the sea that she can do nothing. The
young Tzar, to whom the affair is referred, hastens to
deliver Helen out of the sea; the kid can again skip
about in safety, and everything is green again, and
flourishes as much as it withered before; the witch is
burnt alive.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>

<p>According to the fiftieth story of the sixth book of
<i>Afanassieff</i>, a merchant has three daughters. He builds
a new house, and sends his three daughters by turns to
pass the night there, in order to see what they dream
about. (The belief that the man dreamed of by a maiden
during the night of St John's Day, Christmas Day, or
the Epiphany, is her predestined husband, still exists in
the popular superstitions of Europe.) The eldest daughter
dreams that she marries a merchant's son, the second a
noble, and the third a he-goat. The father commands
his youngest daughter never to go out of the house; she
disobeys; a he-goat appears and carries her off upon his
horns towards a rocky place. Saliva and mucous matter
fall from the goat's mouth and nostrils; the good maiden
is not disgusted, but patiently wipes the goat's mouth.
This pleases the animal, who tells her that if she had
shown horror towards him, she would have had the same
fate as his former wives, whose heads were impaled on a
stake. The geese bring to the girl news of her father
and sisters; they announce that the eldest sister is about
to be married; she wishes to be present at the wedding,
and is permitted by the goat to go, who orders for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
use three horses as black as a crow, who arrive at their
destination in three leaps (the three steps of Vish&#7751;us),
whilst he himself sits upon a flying carpet, and is transported
to the wedding in the form of a handsome and
young stranger. The same happens on the occasion of
the second sister's marriage, when the third sister guesses
that this handsome youth is her own husband. She
departs before the rest, comes home, finds the skin of the
goat and burns it; then her husband always preserves
the form of a handsome youth, inasmuch as the enchantment
of the witch has come to an end.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a></p>

<p>The lamb, the he-goat, and the sheep are favourite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
forms of the witch. In the European story, when the
beautiful princess, in the absence of the prince, her
husband, gives birth to two beautiful sons, the witch
induces the absent prince to believe that, instead of real
sons, his young wife has given birth to pups. In the
seventh story of the third book of <i>Afanassieff</i>, the young
queen gives birth, during the king's absence, to two sons,
of whom one has the moon on his forehead, and the other
a star on the nape of his neck (the Açvinâu). The
wicked sister of the young queen buries the children.
Where they were buried a golden sprout and a silver one
spring up. A sheep feeds upon these plants, and gives
birth to two lambs, having, the one the moon on its head,
the other a star on its neck. The wicked sister, who has
meanwhile been married to the king, orders them to be
torn in pieces, and their intestines to be thrown out into
the road. The good lawful queen has them cooked, eats
them, and again gives birth to her two sons, who grow
up hardy and strong, and who, when interrogated by the
king, narrate to him the story of their origin; their
mother is recognised, and becomes once more the king's
wife; the wicked sister is put to death.<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<p>The witch is sometimes herself (as a wolf-cloud or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
wolf-darkness) a devourer of young luminous kids or
lambs, such as the Schmierbock in the Norwegian story.
The witch carries Schmierbock three times away in a
sack; the first and second time Schmierbock escapes by
making a hole in the sack; but the third time the witch
succeeds in carrying him to her house, where she prepares
to eat him. The cunning Schmierbock, however,
smuggles the witch's own daughter into his place, and,
climbing up, conceals himself in the chimney (a variation
of the stove, the place where the young Russian hero
usually hides himself, in the same way as in the Tuscan
story the foolish Pimpi conceals himself in the oven).
From this post of security he laughs at the witch, who
endeavours to recapture him; he throws a stone down the
chimney and kills her, upon which he descends, rifles her
treasure-stores, and carries off all her gold. Here the
young hero is called a he-goat; in the chapter on the
wolf, we shall find the witch of the Norwegian story
actually bears the name of wolf. These two data complete
the myth; the wolf which wishes to devour the
little hero, and the witch who endeavours to eat the little
lamb, are completed by the fable which represents the
wolf as, at the rivulet, eating the lamb, which, in the
mythical heavens, means the cloudy and gloomy monster
which devours the sun.</p>

<p>We have seen above the witch who imitates the voice
of the mother of the little hero, in order to be able to eat
him, and the wolf who mimics the voice of the goat and
eats the kids; but the wolf does more than assume the
goat's voice; he sometimes even takes her form.</p>

<p>In the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>,<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> A&#501;amukhî, or goat's face, is
called a witch, who wishes Sîtâ to be torn to pieces. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
the legend of Ilvalas and Vâtâpis,<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> the two wizard
brothers who conspire to harm the Brâhma&#7751;âs, Vâtâpis
transforms himself into a wether, and lets himself be
sacrificed in the funeral rites by the Brâhma&#7751;âs. The
unsuspecting Brâhma&#7751;âs eat its flesh; then Ilvalas cries
out to his brother, "Come forth, O Vâtâpis!" and his
brother, Vâtâpis, comes out of the bodies of the Brâhma&#7751;âs,
lacerating them, until the &#7771;ishis Agastyas eats of
himself the whole of Vâtâpis, and burns Ilvalas to ashes.
The <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i> itself explains to us why, in these
sacrifices, a wether, and not a ram, is spoken of,<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> when
it narrates the legend of Ahalyâ. It is said in this passage
that the god Indras was one day condemned to lose his
testicles by the malediction of the &#7771;ishis Gâutamas, with
whose wife, Ahalyâ, he had committed adultery. The
gods, moved to pity, took the testicles of a ram and gave
them to Indras, who was therefore called Meshâ&#7751;&#7693;as;
on this account, says the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, the Pitaras feed
on wethers, and not on rams, in funeral oblations. This
legend is evidently of brâhmanic origin. The Brâhma&#7751;âs,
being interested in discrediting the god of the warriors,
Indras, and finding him called in the Vedâs by the name
of Meshas or ram, invented the story of the ram's testicles,
in the same way as, finding Indras in the Vedâs called
by the name of Sahasrâkshas (<i>i.e.</i>, he of the thousand
eyes), they malignantly connected this appellation with
the same scandalous story of the seduction of Ahalyâ,
and degraded the honourable epithet into an infamous
one, he of the thousand wombs, probably by the
confusion arising out of the equivoque between the
words <i>sahasradhâras</i>, the sun (as carrying, now a
thousand stars, now a thousand rays), or <i>sahasrânçus</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>and <i>sahasradâras</i>, which has a very different
meaning.</p>

<p>In the important 116th hymn of the first book of the
<i>&#7770;igvedas</i>, &#7770;i&#501;râçvas (<i>i.e.</i>, the red horse, or the hero of
the red horse) eats a hundred rams belonging to the she-wolf
(in the following hymn, a hundred and one); his
father blinds him on this account; the two marvellous
physicians, the Açvinâu, give him back his two eyes.<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a>
Evidently the father of the solar hero is here the
gloomy monster of night himself; the sun, at evening,
becomes the devourer of the rams who come out of the
she-wolf, or who belong to the she-wolf; it is for this
reason that the monster wolf blinds him when evening
comes. The red horse &#7770;i&#501;râçvas, or the hero of the red
horse, who eats the rams of the she-wolf, affords a
further key to enable us to understand the expiatory
goat, which in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i> itself is sacrificed instead of
the horse. We are told in a hymn, that in the sacrifice
of the horse the omniform he-goat (a&#501;o viçvarûpa&#7717;) has
preceded the horse;<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> and the <i>Âitareya Br.</i>, commenting
on this exchange of animals, also speaks of the he-goat
as the last animal destined for the sacrifice. In the
Russian stories, too, the goat has to pay the price of the
follies or rogueries done by the man, and is sacrificed.<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a>
This sacrificed he-goat appears to be the same as the ass
which undergoes punishment for all the animals in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>celebrated fable of Lafontaine (which becomes a bull in
the hands of the Russian fabulist Kriloff, who could not
introduce the ass, an animal almost unknown in Russia);
and we already know that the ass represents the sun in
the cloud or the sun in the darkness; and we have also
said that the ass and the fool die together in the legend.
The she-goat dies in the Russian story to deliver the
fool, who, after her death, is a fool no longer, his folly
having died with her.<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> The popular story offers us another
proof of the identity of the mythical ass and the
mythical goat. We have also seen above, in the Norwegian
story, how the witch possesses a treasure which is
carried off by the Schmierbock, who kills her; the
magician, or the devil, is always rich. The ass which the
devil gives to Little Johnny throws gold from its tail;
the ass personifies the devil. But the devil, as we have
observed, also has a predilection to embody himself in a
ram, a lamb, or a he-goat. I remember the puppets
who every day improvised popular representations in the
little wooden theatre on the Piazza Castello, at Turin,
when I was a boy; the final doom of the personage
who represented the tyrant was generally to die under
the bastinadoes of Arlecchino, or to be carried to hell by
the devil in the form of a bleating lamb, which came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
upon the scene expressly to carry him away with him,
this disappearance being accompanied by much throbbing
of the spectators' hearts, to whom the manager preached
a salutary sermon.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> In the twenty-first of the Tuscan
stories published by me, it is not the devil, but the little
old man, Gesù, who gives to the third brother, instead of
the usual ass, a putrid sheep, which, however, has the
virtue of throwing louis-d'or behind it. This putrid, or
wet, or damp sheep represents still better the damp night.</p>

<p>&#7770;i&#501;râçvas, as we have said, eats the ram and becomes
blind, his father having blinded him to avenge the she-wolf
to whom the rams belonged; but the mother of
the rams being the sheep, it is probable that the she-wolf
who possessed the rams had assumed the form of a
putrid sheep, in the same way as we have seen her above
transformed into a she-goat; the father of &#7770;i&#501;râçvas, who
avenges the she-wolf on account of the hundred rams,
may perhaps himself have been a horned wolf transformed
into a he-goat, and have blinded &#7770;i&#501;râçvas with his
horns. In the popular story, the she-goat, when she is
in the forest, takes a special pleasure in wounding people's
eyes with her horns; hence is probably derived the name
of the reptile a&#501;akâvas, conjured with in the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a>
as durd&#7771;içikas, or making to see badly, damaging the
eyesight, and the name of a&#501;akâ, given to an illness in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>the eyes by the Hindoo physician Suçrutas. However,
we must not forget the connection between the idea of
skin and that of goat, by which the a&#501;akâ might mean
simply the thin membrane that sometimes harms the
pupil of the eye, and produces blindness. This thin
membrane, stretched over the eye of the solar hero,
blinds him. We shall see in the chapter on the frog
and the toad, which very often represent, in the myths,
the cloud and the damp night, that the toad<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> causes
blindness only by means of the venom which it is fabled
to exude, like the reptile a&#501;akâvas.</p>

<p>But, as the hero in hell learns and sees everything,
the goat, which deprives others of sight, has itself the
property of seeing everything; this is the case, because
the goat, being the sun enclosed in the cloud or gloomy
night, sees the secrets of hell, and also because, being the
horned moon or starry sky, it is the spy of the heavens.
We have already observed in the first chapter how the
marvellous girl of seven years of age, to answer the acted
riddle proposed by the Tzar, arrives upon a hare, which,
in mythology, represents the moon. In a variation of the
same story given by <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> instead of riding upon
a hare, the royal boy comes upon a goat, and is recognised
by his father; the goat, in its capacity of steed of the lost
hero, seems here to represent the moon, as the hare does.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of Indras sahasrâkshas, <i>i.e.</i>,
of the thousand eyes; Hindoo painters represent him
with these thousand eyes, that is, as an azure sky bespangled
with stars. Indras as the nocturnal sun hides
himself, transformed, in the starry heavens; the stars are
his eyes. The hundred-eyed or all-seeing (panoptês)
Argos placed as a spy over the actions of the cow beloved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>of Zeus, is the Hellenic equivalent of this form of Indras.
In Chapter I. we also saw the witch's daughter of the
Russian fairy tale who has three eyes, and with her third
eye plays the spy over the cow, which protects the good
maiden. In the second story of the sixth book of
<i>Afanassieff</i>, when the peasant ascends into heaven upon
the pea-plant, and enters into a room where geese, hogs,
and pastry are being cooked, he sees a goat on guard;
he only discovers six eyes, as the goat has its seventh
eye in its back; the peasant puts the six eyes to sleep,
but the goat, by means of its seventh eye, sees that the
peasant eats and drinks as much as he likes, and informs
the lord of the sky of the fact. In another variation of
the story, given by <i>Afanassieff</i>,<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> the old man finds in
heaven a little house guarded in turns by twelve goats,
of which one has one eye, another two, a third three,
and so on up to twelve. The old man says to one after
the other, "One eye, two eyes, three eyes, &amp;c., sleep."
On the twelfth day, instead of saying "twelve eyes," he
makes a mistake and says "eleven;" the goat with
twelve eyes then sees and secures him. The eye of God
which sees everything, in the popular faith, is a variation
of Argos Panoptês, the Vedic Viçvavedas, and the
Slavonic Vsievedas, the eye of the goat which sees what
is being done in heaven. When the moon shines in the
sky, the stars grow pale, the eyes of the witch of heaven
fall asleep, but some few eyes still stay open, some few
stars continue to shine to observe the movements of the
cow-moon, the fairy-moon, the Madonna-moon, who protects
the young hero and the beautiful solar maiden lost
in the darkness of night.</p>

<p>This spying goat's eye is perhaps connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
constellation of the goat and two kids. Columella writes
that the kids appear in the sky towards the end of
September, when the west, and sometimes the south,
wind blows and brings rain. According to Servius, the
goat united with the two kids in the constellation of
Aquarius is the same goat which was the nurse of Zeus;
he says that it appears in October, with the sign of
Scorpio. Ovid, in <i>De Arte Amandi</i>, and in the first
book <i>Tristium</i>, and Virgil in the ninth book of the
<i>Æneid</i>,<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> also celebrate the goat and the kids of heaven
as bringers of rain. Horace, in the seventh ode, elegantly
calls the goat's stars insane:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i45">"Ille nothis actus ad Oricum<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Post insana capræ sidera, frigidas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Noctes non sine multis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insomnis lachrymis agit."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We have already seen Indras as a ram or pluvial cloud;
and the goat with only one foot (ekapâd a&#501;a&#7717;), or he
who has but one goat's foot, who supports the heavens,
who lightens and thunders,<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> is a form of the same pluvial
Indras who supports the heavens in the rainy season.
We have seen the Açvinâu compared to two goats, two
horns, two hoofs; each, therefore, would seem to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>but one horn, but one goat's foot (which might perhaps
explain the ekapâd a&#501;a&#7717;); hence on one side the cornucopia,
and on the other the lame goat.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> The nymph
Galathea (the milky one), who loves a faun (or one who
has goat's feet), seems to be a Hellenic form of the loves
of Esmeralda and the goat with Quasimodo. The goat
loves him who has goat's feet; the solar hero (or heroine)
in the night has goat's feet; he is a satyr, a faun, a he-goat,
an ass; he is deformed and foolish, but he interests
the good fairy, who, in the form of a she-goat (as the
moon and as the milky way), guides him in the night,
and, as the dawn (white aurora) in the morning, saves
him and makes him happy. In the German legend, the
poor princess who, with her son, is persecuted in the
forest, is assisted now by a she-goat, now by a doe,
which gives milk to the child; by means of this animal,
which serves as his guide, the prince finds his lost bride.
This guiding she-goat, or doe, the nurse of the child-hero,
which Servius recognised in the constellation of the goat
(with respect to Zeus, who is essentially pluvial, as the
Vedic Indras has the clouds himself for his nurses), must
have generally represented the moon. But even the
milky way of the sky (the bridge of souls) is the milk
spilt by the she-goat of heaven; the white morning sky
is also the milk of this same she-goat. The horned moon,<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a>
the milky way, and the white dawn are represented in the
form of a beneficent she-goat which assists the hero and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>the heroine in the forest, in the darkness; whilst, on the
contrary, the sun enclosed in the cloud, the darkness, or
the starry sky of night (with the insana capræ sidera), is
now a good and wise he-goat or ram, full of good advice,
like the ram who advises the king of India in the <i>Tuti-Name</i>,<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a>
and now a malignant monster, a demoniacal
being. Inasmuch as the goat gives light and milk,
it is divine; inasmuch as it conceals the beauty of
the young hero or heroine and opposes them, it may
be considered demoniacal.</p>

<p>The connection between the she-goat and the milky
way can also be proved from the name St James's Way,
given by the common people to the galaxy, or galathea,
or way of milk;<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> and it is interesting to learn from
Baron Reinsberg,<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> how, in several parts of Bohemia, it is
the custom on St James's Day to throw a he-goat out of
the window, and to preserve its blood, which is said to
be of potent avail against several diseases, such, for
instance, as the spitting of blood. In the <i>Lezioni di
Materia Medica</i> of Professor Targioni-Tozzetti,<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> we also
read that the he-goat's blood was known by no less a
name than <i>manus Dei</i>, and believed to be especially
useful against contusions of the back, pleurisy, and the
stone. But the disease of the stone was supposed to be
cured by the stone called <i>capra</i> (goat), which was said to
be found in the bodies of some Indian goats. Targioni-Tozzetti
himself seriously describes the goat-stones as
follows:&mdash;"These stones are usually clear on their surface,
and dark-coloured; they have an odour of musk
when rubbed and heated by the hands. In them (the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>stone Bezoar<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a>) analeptic and alexipharmic virtues were
supposed to exist, which were able to resist the evil
effects of poison and contagious diseases, the plague not
excepted, and to save the patient by causing an abundant
and healthy perspiration to break out on his skin. For
this reason these stones were sold very dear. The same
virtues are attributed to those found in the West, but
in a much less degree." When the heavenly goat dissolves
in rain or in dew, when moisture comes from the
goat-cloud, the mountain-cloud, or the stone-cloud, these
humours are salutary. When St James, who is joined
with the goat and the rain, pours out his bottle, as the
Piedmontese people say, the vapour which falls from the
sky on these days is considered by the peasants, as in fact
it is for the country, and especially for the vines, a real
blessing. In the fable of <i>Babrios</i>, the vine, whose leaves
are eaten by the he-goat, threatens it, saying that it will
nevertheless produce wine, and that when the wine is
made (<i>i.e.</i>, at the Dionysian mysteries), the goat will be
sacrificed to the gods. In the spring, on the other hand,
or on the Easter of the resurrection, it was the custom to
sacrifice in effigy the <i>Agnus Dei</i>, in the belief that it
would serve to defend the fields and vineyards against
demoniacal wiles, thunderbolts and thunder, facilitate
parturition, and deliver from shipwreck, fire, and sudden
death.<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> In the Witches' Sabbath in Germany, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>said that the witches burned a he-goat, and divided its
ashes among themselves.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>The cunning she-goat is an intermediate form between
the good wise fairy and the witch who is an expert in
every kind of malice. In the same way as the hero, at
first foolish, learns malice from the devil, to use it afterwards
against the devil himself, it may be presumed that
the hero, in his form of a goat, has learned from the
monsters all that cunning by which he afterwards distinguishes
himself. The Vedic ram, Indras, also uses
magic against the monster magicians.</p>

<p>In the second of the Esthonian stories, we read that
the king of the serpents has a golden cup containing the
milk of a heavenly goat; if bread is dipped into this
milk, and put into the mouth, one can discover every
secret thing that has happened in the night, without any
one perceiving how.</p>

<p>In the French mediæval poem of <i>Ysengrin</i>,<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> the she-goat
deceives the wolf in a way similar to that in which,
in the first number of <i>Afanassieff's</i> stories, the peasant
cheats the bear, and in the Italian stories the same
peasant defrauds the devil. The she-goat shows a fox-like
cunning, keeping for itself the leaf of the corn, and
leaving the root for the wolf. Hence, in my eyes, the
origin of the Piedmontese proverbial expression, "La
crava a l'à mangià la föja" (the goat ate the leaf), and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>even the simple one of "Mangé la föja" (to eat the leaf),
meaning to understand cunning.<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> I heard from a certain
Uliva Selvi, at Antignano (near Leghorn), the narrative
of a witch who sent a boy every day to take the she-goat
to the pasturage, ordering him to pay attention that
it should eat well, but leave the corn alone. When the
goat returned, the witch asked it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Capra, mia capra Mergolla,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Come se' ben satolla?"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(Goat, my goat Mergolla,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are you quite satiated?)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To which the goat answered&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Son satolla e cavalcata,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Tutto il giorno digiunata."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I am satiated, and have been ridden;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have fasted all day.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then the boy was put to death by the witch. It happened
thus to twelve boys, until the thirteenth, more cunning,
caressed the goat and gave it the corn to eat; then the
goat answered to the witch's question&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Son ben satolla e governata,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Tutto il giorno m' ha pasturata."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I am quite satiated, and have been well kept;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has given me to eat all day.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And the boy, too, was well treated.</p>

<p>The devil's pupil always outwits his master; the she-goat
beguiles the wolf to its destruction. We have seen
this in the Russian story, and it is confirmed in the
legend of <i>Ysengrin</i>. The peasants of Piedmont and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
Sicily have, for this reason, so much respect for the goat,
that they consider it brings a blessing to the house near
which it is maintained; and if, by chance, they show a
perverse nature, this perversity is attributed to the devil
himself, who, they believe, has maliciously taken possession
of them. A few years ago, a goatherd of the Val
di Formazza, in the Ossola in Piedmont, had two goats
which he believed to be possessed by some evil spirit, for
which reason they always wandered about, in order, as he
thought, that the demon might at last be able to throw
them down some abyss. One day the two goats were
lost; the goatherd searched for them for a short time,
but finding his search bootless, he resolved to go and
make a vow to the Madonna of Einsiedlen. Chance so
arranged it, that at the very moment in which he was
returning from his pious pilgrimage, his two goats also
approached the door of his house; therefore, of course,
this was declared to be a miracle in Formazza, and as
such it is still believed in that district.<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a></p>

<p>In the preceding chapter we saw the ass represented
in two aspects, as regards its generative capabilities;
that is, it is now represented as an ardent, insatiable,
and competent f&#339;cundator, and now as a ridiculous imbecile,
and powerless to generate. We also saw the
ass closely connected with the satyrs with goat's or he-goat's
feet. The he-goats and rams, too, have a double
and self-contradictory reputation. We know, for instance,
that the god Thor, the god of the Scandinavians,
who thunders in the cloud, is drawn by he-goats (the
vessel of Thor and Hymir, the cloud, is called in the
<i>Edda</i> a navigating ram or he-goat, in the same way as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
the Vedic Indras is represented as a god-ram); he is,
moreover, the protector of marriages. Scandinavian
mythology, therefore, appears to regard the goat as essentially
the one that makes fruitful, as a pluvial cloud.
In the Hindoo mythology of the brâhmanic period, the
god Indras loses, on the contrary, his divine power,
becomes stupid and obscure, and is lost in his form of a
ram. In one of his <i>Passeggiate nel Canavese</i>, Signor
A. Bertolotti recently observed, at Muraglio, a curious
custom which is observed by the young men of the
country when a projected wedding falls through; they
run up to the bride's house and obstreperously demand
her to give her sheep up to them, upon which they go to
the bridegroom's house and cry out, "Vente a sarrar quist
motogn" (come and shut up these rams). Here the ram
represents the husband, and the sheep the wife. In Du
Cange the name of goat (caper) is given to the "in pueris
insuavis odor cum ad virilitatem accedunt."<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> In <i>Apuleius</i>,
unmeasured lasciviousness is called "cohircinatio."
According to Ælianos, the he-goat, at the age of seven
days (of seven months according to Columella), already
yearns for coition.</p>

<p>But in the same way as the ass is the stupid patient
animal, the ram is the stupid quiet one. The he-goat is
said to be an indifferent husband, who allows his she-goats
to be covered by other goats without showing a
sign of jealousy; hence our expressions, "horned goat,"
and simply "horned," to indicate the husband of an unfaithful
woman, that is, of a woman who makes him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
wear horns, like the goat, and the Italian proverb, "E
meglio esser geloso che becco" (it is better to be jealous
than a he-goat). This reputation, however, as assigned
to the he-goat, is contrary to all that has been said and
written, and that is known concerning the lust of the he-goat.
On the contrary, Aristotle says explicitly that two
he-goats, which have always lived together in concord at
the pasturage, fall out and fight with violence in the
time of coition. Moreover, the verse of Pindaros is well
known, in which he makes he-goats unite even with
women. It is also said that Hermês, or Zeus, assuming
the form of a he-goat, united himself with Penelope,
whence was born the great goat-footed satyr, Pan; that
Hêraklês (as an ass, in his lion's skin) competed with a
he-goat in phallical powers (in Athenaios he joins himself
with fifty virgins in the space of seven nights); that, in
Ælianos, a jealous he-goat punished with death the goatherd
Crathis, who had incestuously joined himself with
one of his she-goats. Nevertheless, the Greeks already
called by the name of <i>aix</i>, as we Italians by that of
<i>capra</i>, a woman of an immoral life, or an adulteress.
Columella gives us the key of the enigma, observing that
the he-goat, by abuse of the Venus, which he uses too
soon (like the ass), becomes powerless before the age of
six years, so that it is not out of indifference that he is
simply a spectator of his she-goat's infidelity, but only
because he cannot do otherwise. Hence the application
of <i>hircosus</i>, which Plautus gives to an old man.</p>

<p>It is the Hellenic tradition which, more than any
other, developed to a greater extent the myth of the
goat and the sheep, under all their aspects&mdash;demoniacal,
divine, and hybrid.</p>

Iberians gathered up gold, whence the Greek geographer
believed the fable of the golden fleece to have arisen;
the golden lamb kept by Atreus, which was to bring
Thyestes to the throne, and the name of Aigüsthos, born
of the incestuous loves of Thyestes with his own daughter;
Pan (with goat's feet, the son of the he-goat Zeus or
Hermes), who, in the fifth book of the <i>Saturnalians</i> of
Macrobius, loves the moon and obtains its favours by

Endymion, who, according to the commentator Servius,
induces the moon to love him by means of exceedingly

the sixth book of the <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid, seduces
the beautiful virgin Bisaltis; the satyrs, the fauns with
goat's feet, into which the gods transform themselves in
order to seduce nymphs or maidens of the earth, as, for
instance, Jove again, in the same book of Ovid&mdash;</p>

<p>the white lamb sacrificed to Hercules, to Mars, to Jove,
to Neptune, to Bacchus, to Pan (the goat being sacrificed
to Diana), to Apollo (<i>i.e.</i>, when the sun shines), to
Ceres (the goddess of the light-coloured ears of corn), to
Venus, to the gods and goddesses; to his divine forms
(similia similibus); and several other mythical notions
(not to speak of the very popular legend relating
to the goat Amalthea, who nourished Zeus with her
milk, and was by Zeus translated for this service to
the stars, under the name of Aixourania, or heavenly
goat, after he had taken off one of its horns, to give,
in gratitude to the two nymphs who had protected him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
the faculty of pouring out everything that was wished
for);<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> all these account, in an eloquent manner, for
the wide-spread worship that the goat and the sheep
received, even in Græco-Latin antiquity, enriching with
many episodes the mythical and legendary traditions
of these nations, now as the type of a god, now of
a demon, and now of an intermediate being, such as
the satyr, for instance.</p>

<p>In the same way as the mythical horse has, from
evening to morning, three conspicuous moments of
action&mdash;black, grey, and white or red&mdash;and as the
mythical ass throws gold from behind and has golden
ears, so the mythical goat and sheep, which are dark-coloured
in the night or in the cloud, throw gold from
behind and have golden horns which pour out ambrosia,
or else have even the cornucopia itself. It is always the
same myth of the cloudy and aqueous, of the nocturnal
and tenebrous sky, with its two glowing twilights or
auroras, or else of the luminous heavenly hero who
traverses the night or the cloud (or the wintry season),
disguised in the shapes of various animals, now by his
own will, now by a divine malediction or by diabolical
witchcraft.</p>

<p>In the third book of Aristotle's <i>History of Animals</i>,
we read of the river Psikros in Thrace, that white sheep,
when they drink of its waters, bring forth black lambs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
that in Antandria there are two rivers, of which one
makes the sheep black, and the other white, and that the
river Xanthos or Skamandros makes the sheep fair (or
golden). This belief involves in itself the three transformations
of the celestial hero into the three he-goats or
rams of different natures, of which we have spoken.
The last transformation calls our attention to the sheep
with golden wool, the golden lamb, and the <i>Agnus Dei</i>,
the symbol of happiness, power and riches. Wealth in
sheep, even more than wealth in cows, became the
symbol of universal riches. The horn poured out every
kind of treasure upon the earth, and upon the earth
itself the <i>pecus</i> became <i>pecunia</i>.</p>

tree; <i>agas</i> (properly that which does not move) expresses equally
tree and mountain. Hence perhaps the Italian proverb: <i>Le montagne

men meet; hence the cry of Râmas in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, ii. 122, that
the Himâlayas would move before he should become a traitor; hence
the assurance with which Macbeth, after the celebrated prophecy of

forest; bid the tree unfix his earth-bound root?" <i>Shakespeare</i> (<i>Macbeth</i>,
iv. 1.) Nevertheless the forest moved, as it not unfrequently does in
the myths, where the tree-clouds walk, and fill all with terror wherever
they go, where heroes and monsters often fight, by unrooting the trees
of a whole forest. Cfr. <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, iii. 3, 5, and the chapters of this

Petersburg), 1848, we find two valiant heroes who, upon Mount
G&#7771;idhrakû&#7789;a (the vulture's peak), strive, in presence of their master, to
lift the va&#501;ram (that is, the arm in the form of a wedge, the lever-rod,
the thunderbolt of Indras), but in vain; Va&#501;rapâ&#7751;is alone succeeds in
lifting the va&#501;ram with his right hand. Râmas makes a similar trial
of strength in the <i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, when he lifts and breaks in pieces a
bow, which no one had before been able even to move.</p>

good eyesight, and her splendour, the way to the lost heroes. The
Hindoo cow of Vasish&#7789;has, which yields every good thing, and which
then fights in the clouds against Viçvâmitras, would sometimes appear
to be the moon veiled by the rainy cloud; thus we can explain the rain-giving

by raining ten days and ten nights, destroyed the monsters of dryness
created by the demon Ag&#771;ro-mai&#7751;yus.</p>

Tage und dreier Nächte hin zu seiner eigenen Wohnung, nicht abwärts,
nicht abwärts gelangte er genährt. Er ging hervor gegen die Morgenröthe

und betete zur Ardvî Çûra, der fleckenlosen; Ardvî Çûra, fleckenlose! eile mir schnell zu Hülfe, bringe nun mir Beistand, ich will dir tausend
Opfer mit Haoma und Fleisch versehene, gereinigte, wohl ausgesuchte,
bringen hin zu dem Wasser Ragha, wenn ich lebend hinkomme zu der
von Ahura geschaffenen Erde, hin zu meiner Wohnung. Es lief herbei

sehr kräftigen, wohlgewachsenen, aufgeschürzten, reinen, mit glänzendem
Gesichte, edlen, unten am Fusse mit Schuhen bekleidet, mit
goldnem Diadem auf dem Scheitel. Diese ergriff ihm am Arme, bald

Tagesanbruch," which in a note he explains, "Vom Sonnenaufgang
bis Mitternacht," which it appears to us cannot stand scrutiny, any
more than the conclusion inferred from this, that the sacrifice was to
be made "den ganzen Tag hindurch." Zarathustra would not have
been obliged to ask the precise time at which to sacrifice to the goddess,
if she was to answer him in such a general way. What occasion
is there to pray in midday, in full daylight, that the darkness may be
dispersed?&mdash;If there be any equivoque, it can only be, in my opinion,
in the rather frequent exchange of the maiden Aurora and the fairy
Moon.</p>

of the collection of Kreuzwald, pp. 144 and 145.&mdash;[This is also a
myth of easy interpretation, if I am not mistaken: at evening, the
sun loses his rays; the lion, the hero, loses his nails; these nails are
picked up by the demoniacal monster, who forms out of them a hat
(the gloom of night, or the clouds), by which the wearer has the
gift of seeing without being seen. The magician who sees with his
eyes shut is an interesting variation of this subject.]</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_347_347" id="Footnote_347_347"></a><a href="#FNanchor_347_347"><span class="label">[347]</span></a> A similar antithesis is found in a Hungarian proverb, communicated
to me by my learned friend Count Geza Kunn, together with
other notices of Hungarian beliefs relating to animals. This proverb
is as follows: "Even the black cow's milk is white." The black cow
is spoken of in two other Hungarian proverbs; one says, "The black
cow has not trodden upon his heel," meaning that no misfortune has
happened to him; it is the usual vulnerable heel, the heel of Achilles,
the posterior part, for which is substituted sometimes, as we shall see
in the chapter on the Fox and the Serpent, the tail or extreme hind
part. Another proverb is, "In the dark all cows are black;" but it
does not seem to have any mythical importance.</p>

more voluminous N. Aphanasieva, <i>Narodnija ruskija skaski</i>, Isd. 2
(Moskva 1860, 1861), have not thus far been translated into other
European languages. I have therefore thought fit to make copious
quotations from them as well for the use of Western readers, as on
account of the real importance of their mythical contents, whilst
awaiting the publication of the competent work which Mr Ralston is
expressly preparing upon Russian songs.</p>

husband and wife, the good fairy is accustomed to bring to the child,
husband, and wife, a boot or a stocking full of presents. This nuptial
boot occurs again in the English custom of throwing a slipper after a
newly-married couple. Another meaning was also given to the slippers
which are thrown away in the popular belief. Instead of being the
heroine's shoes which, having been abandoned, serve to attract and
guide the predestined husband, they are also considered as the old
shoes which the devil leaves behind him when he flees (his tail, which
betrays itself). The Germanic wild huntress Gueroryssa, another form
of the Frau Holle&mdash;the phantom of winter expelled at Epiphany&mdash;is
represented with a serpent's tail. Hence in the German carnival the
use of the <i>Schuh-teufel laufen</i>, or running in the devil's slippers.</p>

objects far away and says, that he who is able to find them will have

(the old sun) falls from the sky into a marsh (the sea of night), a duck
(the moon or the aurora) comes to make its nest and lay an egg upon
his head; the peasant clutches hold of its tail; the duck struggles and draws the peasant out of the marsh (the sun out of the night),
and the peasant with the duck and its egg flies and returns to his
house (the sky whence he had fallen).&mdash;In a variation of the same story
in <i>Afanassieff</i> (the two stories together refer to that of Aristomenes)
the old man falls from heaven into the mud. A fox places seven
young foxes on his head. A wolf comes to eat the young foxes; the
peasant catches hold of his tail; the wolf, by one pull, draws him out;
by another, leaves his tail in the peasant's hand. The tail of the wolf
of night is the morning aurora.&mdash;In the story of <i>Turn-Little-Pea</i>,
<i>Afanassieff</i>, iii. 2, the young hero enters into the horse after having
taken off his (black) hide, and after having taken him by the tail, <i>i.e.</i>,
he becomes the luminous horse of the sun.</p>

kills the monster-serpent by gambling with him for the price of his
own skin. Thinking that he may lose, he has provided himself beforehand
with seven ox hides and with iron claws. He loses seven times;
each time the monster thinks he has him in his power, but the workman
as often imposes upon him with an ox's hide, inducing him to
believe that it is his own. At last the serpent loses, and the workman,
with his iron claws, really takes off his skin, upon which the
serpent dies. To take the sack or hide from the monster, to burn the
skin of the monster-serpent, goat, hog, frog, &amp;c., to burn the enchanted
mantle or hood in which the hero is wrapped up, is the same as to kill
the monster.</p>

of a lunar eclipse might have contributed materially, in which
the cow earth (in Sansk&#7771;it, <i>go</i> means earth as well as cow) really
passes over the moon or hare. Or else, the cloud and the night, as a

wheels of the vehicle which carries a newly-married couple, it bodes

moon is the protectress of marriages; if she throws obstacles in the
way, the marriage cannot be happy; consequently, marriages in India
were celebrated at full moon.</p>

upon an elm-tree, and wishes to climb up; the ascent never comes to
an end; the tree takes him up near to heaven. On the summit of
the elm-tree there is a nest, from which comes forth a beautiful fair-haired
maiden (the moon).</p>

wishes to fix his eyes upon the princess who never laughs, falls into a
marsh; the fish, the beetle, and the mouse, in gratitude, clean him
again; then the princess laughs for the first time, and marries the
honest workman. In the 25th of the <i>Novelline di Santo Stefano</i>, an
analogous detail is found, but this is not enough to make the princess
laugh; it is the eagles which draw after themselves everything they
touch that accomplish the miracle of making the queen's daughter
laugh. In the third story of the <i>Pentameron</i>, the princess laughs
upon seeing Pervonto carried by the faggot of wood, instead of carrying
it. The Russian stories of the ducks which save the hero, in
<i>Afanassieff</i>, vi. 17-19, and the faithless wife and her lover bound
together, are variations of the eagles of the Tuscan story.</p>

demoniacal; hence the sacrament of confirmation was given him to
deliver him from this diabolical faculty, and the paper narrates that
he was immediately deprived of it. The blind hero who sees, who
distinguishes his cows from each other, is the sun in the cloud. No
sooner does he receive confirmation (which is a second baptism), than
he ceases to see his cows, for the simple reason that the clouds are
dissolved in rain, or that himself has recovered his vision.</p>

represented as a tablecloth that lays itself. Thus the poor man
who goes to sell his cow's hide finds the pot of abundance and riches.
The dispute for the tablecloth is the same as the dispute for riches,
for the beautiful princess who is afterwards divided, or else carried off
by a third or fourth person who takes the lion's share. We must not
forget the fable of the animals who wish to divide the stag among
themselves, of which the lion takes all, because he is named lion. In
the <i>Nibelungen</i>, Schilbung and Nibelung dispute with each other for
the division of a treasure; they beg Sîfrit to divide it; Sîfrit solves
the question by killing them both and taking to himself the treasure,

harmony with the popular stories of an analogous character; the false
wife really causes King Pepin to marry her, and sends Berta into the
forest to be killed; the hired murderers pity her, and grant her her
life. Berta, whilst in the forest bound to a tree (like the Vedic cow),
is found by a hunter; out of gratitude she works (she, no doubt, spins
and weaves), in order that the hunter may sell her work at Paris for a
high price. Meanwhile her father and mother dream that she is beset
by bears and wolves who threaten to devour her, that thereupon,
throwing herself into the water, a fisherman saves her (in the dream,
the water has taken the place of the forest, and the fisherman that of
the hunter). King Pepin goes into the forest, finds her, recognises and marries her, whilst Elizabeth is burnt alive. The change of wives
also occurs in a graceful form (with a variation of the episode of the
beauty thrown into the fountain) in the twelfth of the <i>Contes Merveilleux</i>
of Porchat, Paris, 1863.</p>

of <i>Renard</i>, on occasion of the apparent death of the fox, the gospel is
read, on the contrary, by the horse. In the German customs the bull
also appears as a funeral animal, and is fastened to the hearse. If,
while he is drawing the hearse, he turns his head back, it is considered
a sinister omen. According to a popular belief, the bulls and other
stalled animals speak to each other on Christmas night. A tradition
narrates, that a peasant wished on that night to hide himself and hear
what the bulls were saying; he heard them say that they would soon
have to draw him to the grave, and died of terror. This is the usual
indiscretion and its punishment.&mdash;Cfr. Rochholz, <i>Deutscher Glaube und
Brauch</i>, Berlin, 1867, i. 164, and Menzel, <i>Die Vorchristliche Unsterblichkeits-Lehre</i>,
Leipzig, 1870.&mdash;We have the speaking oxen again in
Phædrus's fable of the stag who takes refuge in the stable, ii. 8,
where the master is called "ille qui oculos centum habet."</p>

he is a male form of the wooden girl, of the wise puppet, of
the sun hidden in the trunk of a tree, in the tree of night, in the nocturnal (or cloudy, or wintry) night, full of mysteries, which the
little solar hero surprises from his hiding-place. The hero in hell, or
who, educated by the devil, learns every kind of evil, is a variation of
this multiform idea. The dwarf of <i>Porchat</i>, who comes out of the
clothes-press, is in perfect accord with the popular belief which makes
the man be born in the wood, on the stump of a tree, of which the
Christmas-tree is a lively reminiscence.</p>

St Luke; in Russia, to the saints Froh and Laver. In Sicily, the protector
of oxen is San Cataldo, who was bishop of Taranto. (For the
notices relating to Sicilian beliefs concerning animals, I am indebted
to my good friend Giuseppe Pitrè.) In Tuscany, and in other parts of
Italy, oxen and horses are recommended to the care of St Antony, the
great protector of domestic animals. In the rural parts of Tuscany,
it was the custom, on the 17th of February, to lead oxen and horses to
the church-door, that they might be blessed. Now, to save trouble,
only a basket of hay is carried to be blessed; which done, it is taken
to the animals that they may eat it and be preserved from evil. On
Palm Sunday, to drive away every evil, juniper is put into the stables
in Tuscany.</p>

connection with the apple-tree, a vegetable form, and with the cornucopia,
since both are seers, and spies, and guides. The golden doe is a

<p><a name="Footnote_549_549" id="Footnote_549_549"></a><a href="#FNanchor_549_549"><span class="label">[549]</span></a> Cfr. the first of the Tuscan stories of <i>Santo Stefano di Calcinaia</i>.&mdash;In
the preceding chapter, we have seen how the apples of a certain
apple-tree cause horns to grow on whoever eats them. In an unpublished
Italian story, instead of the apple-tree, we have the fig-tree,
and instead of horns, the tail. It is narrated by an old man of
Osimo, in the Marches:&mdash;Three poor brothers, having but little inclination
for work, go in search of fortune round the world. Overtaken
in the country by night, they fall asleep in the open air. A
fairy, under the aspect of a hideous old woman, comes up and wakens
them, offering herself as their wife. The three brothers excuse themselves,
and declare that they wish for nothing except a little money
with which to make merry. The fairy answers, "Tell me what you wish for, and you shall have it." The first asks for a purse, which shall
always be full of money; the second for a whistle, by blowing into
which a whole army of brave combatants would be summoned to his
side; the third a mantle, which would make its wearer invisible. The
fairy satisfies them, and then disappears in flames, like the devil. The
eldest brother, Stephen, goes with his purse into Portugal, where he
plays and loses, but still remains rich. This comes to the queen-dowager's
ears, who wishes to see the stranger, hoping to possess herself
of his secret; she feigns to love him, and the wedding-day is fixed;
but before it comes she has already gained his confidence, and taking
the purse from him, she orders him to be flogged. Stephen returns to
his brothers, relates his grievance, and proposing to revenge himself
upon the queen, induces them to lend him the whistle, which calls
armies into existence. The queen softens towards him, protesting
that she expected to the last that he would have appeared on the day
appointed for the wedding, and that he had been flogged without her
knowledge. Stephen gives way, and the whistle passes out of his
hands into those of the queen. He is flogged again, but twice as
severely as before. Again he has recourse to his brothers; he implores,
supplicates, and promises to get everything back by the miraculous
mantle; but having obtained it, he allows himself to be deceived once
more by the queen. Deprived of everything, he wanders about in
despair, reduced to beggary. In the middle of January, he sees a tree
covered with beautiful figs; desirous of them, he eats with avidity;
but for every fig that he swallows, a span of tail as thick as a boa grows
on to him. He goes on his way, still more desperate, till he finds
more figs, of a smaller size; he eats them, and the tail disappears.
Contented with this discovery, he fills a basket with the first figs, and
disguised as a countryman, comes to the palace of the Queen of
Portugal. Every one marvels on seeing such fine figs in January.
The queen buys the basket, and every one eats; but tails immediately
grow on their backs. Stephen then dresses himself as a doctor, and
with the little figs, cures many persons. The queen has him called;
he obliges her to confess to him first, and in the confession makes her
say where the three marvellous gifts of the fairy are kept. Having
recovered them, he leaves the queen with ten spans of tail, and returns
rich and happy to his brothers. In this story there must be some
parts wanting; it is probable that the fairy warned the brothers not to discover their secret to any one. The last enterprise, moreover, is
more likely to have been undertaken by the third brother, who always
assumes in fairy tales the part of the cunning one, than by the first-born,
who in this story represents the part of the fool.&mdash;Polydorus
speaks of the horse's tail as a chastisement for an insult to Thomas Archbishop
of Canterbury, in the thirteenth book of his <i>Hist. Angl.</i>:&mdash;"Irridentes
Archiepiscopum, caudam equi cui insidebat, amputarunt.
At postea nutu Dei ita accidit, ut omnes ex eo hominum genere qui
id facinus fecissent, nati sunt instar brutorum caudati."</p>

the demon who, during the night, makes the horses sweat and grow
lean, <i>i.e.</i>, who makes them ugly. In the Latin tradition, after having
assisted the Romans in the battle of the Lake Regillus, Castor and
Pollux were seen, near the ambrosial lacus Iuturnæ (Ovidius, <i>Fasti</i>, i.),
to wash the sweat off their horses with the water of this lake, which
was near the temple of Vesta. To this Macaulay alludes in his
verses&mdash;</p>

The salutary water of the Dioscuri, or sons of the luminous one, would
here occupy the place of the fire lighted by night in stables, and of
the Vedic Agnis who kills the monster of horses. My friend Giuseppe
Pitrè writes me, that in Sicily, when an ass, a mule, or a horse is to
enter a new stable, salt is put upon its back (a form of Christian
baptism), in order that the fairies may not lame it.&mdash;The Küllaros,
the heroic horse of the Dioscuri, is perhaps not unrelated to the word
<i>küllos</i>, which means lame and bent; the solar horse, before being
heroic, is hump-backed, lame, lean, and ugly; the lame hero, the lame
horse (ass or mule), the lame devil, seem to me to be three <i>penumbræ</i>
of the solar hero, or of the sun in the darkness.</p>

there seems to me to be room for discussion. The text says: Utâ
yâtam sañgave prâtar ahno (that is, in the early dawn, when the cows
are gathered together), madhyandine (which, in my mind, is the middle
term which separates the gloomy hours from the luminous ones),
uditâ sûryasya (which, meaning the rising of the sun, cannot express
evening, but precisely the rising of the morning sun). We too would
have thus expressed the three moments in the morning in which it
was opportune to invoke the Açvinâu.</p>

day. Odin took Natt and Dag her son, gave them two horses and
two drays, and placed them in the heavens to go round the earth in
twenty-four hours. Natt was the first to advance with Hrimfaxe, her
horse; he scatters every morning the foam from his bit upon the
earth; it is the dew. The horse of Dag is named Skenfaxe; the air
and the earth are illumined by his mane.</p>

words with which Professor Roth begins his essay upon the legend of
Çuna&#7717;çepas in the first volume of the <i>Indische Studien</i>: "Die Deutung der indischen Sagengeschichte sucht noch die Regeln, nach welchen
die das überlieferte verworrene Material behanden soll. Eine und
dieselbe Sage wird vielleicht in zehn verschiedenen Büchern in zehnfacher
Form erzählt. Glaubt man einen festen Punkt gefunden zu
haben, auf welchen nach einem Berichte die Spitze der Erzählung
zusammenläuft, so streben andere Berichte wieder nach ganz anderem
Ziele und treiben denjenigen, der einen festen Kern der Sage fassen
will, rathlos im Kreise herum. Die Widersprüche, mit welchen ein
Sammler und Ordner griechischer Heldensagen zu kämpfen hat, sind
lauter Einklang und Klarheit im Vergleiche zu dem wirren Knäuel, in
welchen die Willkühr indischer Poeten die reichen Ueberlieferungen
ihrer Vorzeit zusammengeballt hat."</p>

brothers to steal the treasure, in an as yet unpublished fairy tale of
the Canavese in Piedmont, was employed by the inexperienced robber,
who becomes at length very skilful to rob the loaves from the baker's
oven. The Piedmontese thief makes an opening from without, and
thus carries the bread off. The same thief then steals the king's
horse. At first, he learns his profession from the chief of the robbers.
The chief sends him the first time to waylay some travellers, and bids
him leap upon them; the young thief obeys these directions to the
letter; he makes the travellers lie down and then jumps upon them,
but does not rob them. The second time the chief tells him to take
the travellers' quattrini (the name of a very small coin, by which
money in general is also expressed). The young thief takes the
quattrini alone, and lets the travellers keep their dollars and napoleons.
At last, however, he becomes an accomplished thief.</p>

generally the fish eaten by the queen and her servant-maid which
gives life to the two brothers, who become three when the water in
which the fish was washed is given to be drunk by the mare or the
bitch, whence the son of the mare or bitch is born. I have already
attempted to prove the identity of the fish with the phallos; the fish
eaten by the queen, the maid, the mare, or the bitch, which renders
them pregnant, seems to me a symbol of coition. The horse's fat or
marrow smelled by the queen seems to have the same meaning.</p>

for instance, it is narrated that the church dedicated to the <i>Corpus
Domini</i> was erected several centuries ago on account of the miracle of
a mule which carried some sacred goods stolen by an impious thief.
Having arrived in the little square where the Church of the <i>Corpus Domini</i> now stands, the mule refused to go any farther; and out of a
cup, which was among the sacred objects stolen, a wafer containing the
body of our Saviour rose into the air. Nor would it come down again
until the bishop came forth, and, holding the cup high in the air,
besought the wafer to come back into it; which having been
miraculously accomplished, the Church of the <i>Corpus Domini</i> was
erected on the spot, from which starts and to which returns the
solemn procession which takes place annually at Turin on the festival
of <i>Corpus Domini</i>, and in which, about twenty years ago, the princes
and great dignitaries of the state, with the professors of the university,
used to take part in all the pomp of mediæval ceremony and costume.&mdash;In
Persia the festival of asses is celebrated at the approach

custom among children in the middle of Lent&mdash;that is, near the
festival of St Joseph&mdash;of attaching to their companions now a saw, now
a devil's head, now an ass's head, pronouncing the words, "L'asu
cariá che gnün lu sa" (the ass burdened, and no one knows it). Moreover,
it seems to me that to the Christian tradition of Joseph, and of
the child Jesus carried upon the ass, can be referred the well-known
European fable of the old man, the boy, and the ass, of which
numerous varieties may be read in the article upon the <i>asinus vulgi</i> in

hanc iconem quam hippokentauri esse credebam, ipse vero (nescio ex
quo) Apothami vocat, Apothami (inquit) in aqua morantes, qui una
parte hominem, alia vero caballum sive equum referunt. Sic etiam
memoriæ tradiderunt mulieres esse capite plano sine crinibus, promissas
autem barbas habentes. Atqui ea descriptio plane ad Onocentauros
pertinere videtur, quos Aelianus et Philes sic fere delineant. Quæ
vero de Onocentauro fama accepi, hæc sunt: Eum homini ore et
promissa barba similem esse, simul et collum et pectus, humanam
speciem gerere; mammas distantes tamquam mulieris ex pectore
pendere; humeros, brachia, digitos, humanam figuram habere; dorsum,
ventrem, latera, posteriores pedes, asino persimiles et quemadmodum
asinum sic cinereo colore esse; imum ventrem leviter exalbescere:
duplicem usum ei manus præstare; nam celeritate ubi sit opus eæ
manus præcurrunt ante posteriores pedes; ex quo fit, ut non cæterorum
quadrupedum cursu superetur. Ac ubi rursus habet necesse vel cibum
capere vel aliud quidpiam tollere, qui ante pedes erant manus efficiuntur,
tumque non graditur, sed in sessione quiescit: Animal est gravi
animi acerbitate; nam si capiatur, non ferens servitutem, libertatis
desiderio ab omni cibo abhorret, et fame sibi mortem consciscit, licet
pullus adhuc fuerit. Hæc de Onocentauro Pythagoram narrare testatur
Crates, ex Mysio Pergamo profectus;" Aldrovandi, <i>De Quadrupedibus</i>,
i.&mdash;In the Indian satyrs described by Pliny, in the seventh book of
his <i>Natural History</i>, we find represented an analogous animal: "Sunt
et satyri subsolanis Indorum montibus (Cartadulonum dicitur regio)
pernicissimum animal, turn quadrupes, turn recte currens, humana
effigie, propter velocitatem nisi senes aut ægri, aut capiuntur." Evidently
this refers to some kind of monkey (probably the orang-outang);
but as the myth of the monkey does not differ much from that of the
ass, as we shall see, even the Hindoo gandharvas is represented as a
monkey.&mdash;"In <i>A. V.</i> iv. 37, 11, the gandharvas, a class of gods, who
are described as hairy, like dogs and monkeys, but as assuming a
handsome appearance to seduce the affections of earthly females, are
implored to desist from this unbecoming practice, and not to interfere
with mortals, as they had wives of their own, the Apsarases;"
Muir's <i>Sansk&#7771;it Texts</i>, v. 309.&mdash;We have the monkey-gandharvas and
the warrior-gandharvas in the Vedic hymns, the warrior-monkey in the
<i>Râmâya&#7751;am</i>, and the warrior-kentauros and warrior-ass in Hellenic
myths.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_701_701" id="Footnote_701_701"></a><a href="#FNanchor_701_701"><span class="label">[701]</span></a> We also read of the ass that dances, which reminds us of the gandharvas
in their capacity of heavenly musicians and dancers, who teach
the gods how to dance. Nor is it perhaps without reason that the
author of precepts for dancers and mimics is named <i>K&#7771;içâçvas</i>: k&#7771;içâçvas
means, as we already know, he who possesses a lean horse, or simply
the lean horse. Between the lean horse, the mule, and the ass, the
distance is short; nor can we overlook the fact that in the gandharvas
K&#7771;içânus is recognised as he who causes to become lean, which calls us
back to the monster who makes horses grow lean, to the monster of
horses, the ugly horse, the horse-monster, who destroys the golden ears

ass, generally considered a very lustful animal, is sometimes despised

Aldrovandi (<i>De Quadrupedibus</i>, i.)&mdash;Quamvis modo libidine maxime

in the preceding chapter, how the two horsemen who protect the hero
come out of the ears of the grey horse, and how the hero himself, entering
by one ear, and coming out of the other, finds a heroic horse.
Here we can, perhaps, detect an allusion to the long-eared ass, in the
same way as in the appellation of âçrutkar&#7751;as, or the ear which listens,
given to Indras (<i>&#7770;igv.</i> i. 10, 9), the long-eared Indras may possibly
be a form representing the long-eared Midas, or the ass with long ears.</p>

Fanfani in his <i>Vocabolario dell' Uso Tuscano</i>, Firenze, 1863:&mdash;"Each
member of the party chooses an animal whose voice or song he must imitate. The head player represents the ass, and is the king of the
other animals. When the head player, sitting in the middle, calls one
of the animals who encircle him, the dog, for instance, this animal
must bark; when he calls the cock, it must cry chicchiricù; when he
calls the ox, he who represents it must bellow, and so on. When the
ass brays, then all the animals emit their respective cries. Whoever
laughs, or omits to give forth the voice or song of the animal which he
represents, pays a forfeit."</p>

beloved of Pan, who was changed into a cane or reed, from which Pan
made a flute. We find the leaf of the cane in connection with the ass
in Hungarian tradition. A singular indentation can be observed upon
the leaves of the cane, which has a great resemblance to the mark of
three teeth. To explain this strange mark the Hungarian people narrate, that the ass of the Redeemer once bit the leaf of a cane, but
as Christ was in a hurry, the ass was unable to eat the leaf, and so it
happened that its three teeth only left the mark of the bite upon the
cane. From that time forward every leaf of a cane bears record to
this. The two lines which stretch down the two flanks of the ass are
said in Hungary to be caused by the blood of our Redeemer. The
popular belief in Ireland is that these lines remain as a memorial of
Christ having once struck the ass.&mdash;Cfr. the chapter on the Peacock

"Quí mi casca l'asino" (here my ass falls). This expression, however,

to fall off the ass and to fall from one's mind became synonymous.</p>

The latter asks his mother for a quattrino (a small coin) to buy a
vetch, and afterwards a bean, because it grows higher; he sows it, and
it attains a marvellous height. Climbing up the bean-stalk he comes
to the gates of paradise, which are opened to him, but St Peter sends
him back; he then finds the entrance to hell, which he wishes to
visit. The devil shows him all the sights; the two then play at cards,
and Pipetta wins a sackful of souls. The devil fears that Pipetta
will empty hell, so he allows him to depart with the sack, and an ass
which throws gold from its tail; he mounts up to heaven, and consigns
the sack of souls to St Peter. The story ends with the usual
exchange of asses at the inn where Pipetta sleeps upon his descent
from the beanstalk.</p>

divides it, giving to the ass the hay that the lion has in its mouth,

one (agilis). To illustrate the same analogies in the case of the Greek
myth, it will be useful to repeat the words of Professor Bréal: "Le
verbe grec <i>aïssô</i>, qui signifie s'élancer, a fait d'une part le substantif
<i>aix</i>, chèvre (à cause de la nature bondissante de l'animal), et de l'autre
les mots <i>kataïx, kataigis, tempête</i> (as it seems to me, that which
shakes, which causes to move or tremble, inasmuch as I maintain that
<i>a&#501;as</i> does not mean the movable, or him that rushes, so much as him
that pushes, that butts, or causes to move). De là une nouvelle série
d'images et de fables où la chèvre joue le rôle principal. L'égide,
avant d'être un bouclier fait en peau de chèvre, était le ciel au moment
de l'orage; Jupiter aigiochos était le dieu qui envoie la tempête; plus
tard, on traduisit le dieu qui porte l'égide. Homère semble se souvenir
de la première signification, quand il nous montre, au seul mouvement
du bouclier le tonnerre qui éclate, l'Ida qui se couvre de nuages et les
hommes frappés de terreur." Mr Ralston compares very well the
Russian <i>ablakagragonniki</i> (cloud-compellers) to the Zeus <i>nephelêgeretes</i>.
In the <i>&#7770;igv.</i> i. 10, 8, it is said similarly to Indras: &#501;esha&#7717; svarvatîr

boiard asks the reason; the hen accuses the cock, the cock accuses the
walnut-tree, the walnut-tree accuses the goat, the goat accuses the
shepherd, the shepherd accuses the housewife, the housewife accuses
the hog, the hog accuses the wolf, the wolf accuses God, but beyond
God it is impossible to go.&mdash;In another jest in verse, intended to
exercise the memory and loosen the tongue, and given by <i>Afanassieff</i>,
iv. 16, we find the goat in connection with hazel-nuts. The he-goat
begins to complain that the she-goat does not come back with the
hazel-nuts (níet kaszi s ariehami); the song goes on to say, that the
he-goat will send the wolf to find the she-goat, the bear after the wolf,
the men after the bear, the oak-tree after the men, the axe after the
oak-tree, the grindstone after the axe, the fire after the grindstone, the water after the fire, and the hurricane after the water; then the
hurricane sends the water, the water the fire, the fire burns the grindstone,
the stone grinds the axe, the axe cuts down the oak-tree, the
oak-tree made into a stick (as we have already seen in Chapters I. and
II.) beats the men, the men shoot against the bear, the bear fights
with the wolves, the wolves hunt the she-goat, and here the she-goat
comes back with the hazel-nuts (vot kasza s ariehami).</p>

Fucecchio in Tuscany.
</p><p>
There was once a queen that had a son, who, at the age of seven
years, was enchanted, so that he lay constantly in bed like one deprived
of life. Only at midnight he went out of the house, returning
at one o'clock, covered with blood, and throwing himself as if
dead into the bed. A woman had to remain regularly on the watch
for the purpose of opening the door for him at midnight and at one
o'clock; but no girl had, from very fright, been able to continue in the
service more than one night. Near the city lived an old woman with
three daughters; the two eldest tried to discharge the prescribed
duty, but were overcome with fear; the youngest, more courageous,
remained. The first night, at twelve o'clock, the dead man lifts up
one arm; she runs to him and lifts the other; he tries to raise himself;
she helps him to get out of bed. At one o'clock he returns
covered with blood, and the girl asks him who has reduced him to this
condition, but he answers nothing, and throws himself on the bed as if
a corpse. The second night she follows him, and sees him enter a
subterranean cavern; he comes to the foot of a flight of stairs, puts
down his mantle and remains as naked as when he was born, a handsome
youth of eighteen years of age. At the summit of the stairs two
great witches cry, "Here he is! come, pretty one!" He ascends and
is beaten by the witches for an hour till blood flows, he crying out the
while for mercy. At one o'clock he is allowed to go, comes back to the
foot of the stairs, takes his mantle and returns home dead. The third night his attendant again follows him, and when he puts down
his mantle at the foot of the stairs and goes up, she takes the mantle
and presses it tightly; the witches scream. The young man comes to
the summit; but when they try to beat him they cannot lift the stick.
Perceiving this, the girl presses and bites the mantle; when she does
so, the witches feel themselves bitten; then the girl runs to the
palace, orders a great fire to be lighted, and throws the mantle into it;
upon its being burnt, the two witches expire, their enchantment is
destroyed, and the prince marries his deliverer.</p>

belonging to the king, persuades him to believe that her life is forfeit,
and can be ransomed only by the sacrifice of the wether. The peasant,
overcome partly by love and partly by compassion, gives way and
consents to the sacrifice. The minister hopes that the peasant will
conceal his fault, but is disappointed in his expectation, inasmuch as,
on the contrary, he ingenuously confesses everything; and he becomes,
in consequence, yet dearer to the king.</p>

who pass the sea or fly through the air with the sheep, is connected
the Russian story recorded above of Ivan and Helena; Ivan is changed
into a little kid or lamb. In the Italian variety of the same story,
the sister is thrown into the sea by the witch. Whilst the brother and
sister pass the Hellespont upon the golden ram, Helle falls into the
sea. We learn from Apôllonios, in the second book of the <i>Argon.</i>,
that the fleece of the sheep became gold only when, on its arrival in
Colchis, it was sacrificed and suspended upon an oak-tree. The cloud-ram
becomes golden only in the morning and evening sky.&mdash;The
luminous fleece can perhaps be recognised in the bride of the <i>&#7770;igvedas</i>,
who, leaning towards the relations of Kakshîvant, says: "Every day
I shall be (properly speaking, I am) like the little woolly sheep of
the gandhâri (sarvâham asmi romaçâ gandhârî&#7751;âm ivâvikâ);" <i>&#7770;igv.</i> i.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
